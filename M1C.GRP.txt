Whoa! We've got to be
careful! I don't want to
end up like that snowball![BRK]

But now that it's fallen,
do you think it plugged the
gap down the mountain?[BRK]

If so, we might be able to 
get across. Let's go check
it out!

Ha! Maybe that snowball will
plug the other gap we
couldn't pass![BRK]

We should head back down the
mountain and check![END]

Oh, Hiro! I'm so happy
you're awake again...[BRK]

Please be still. I must
heal your wounds...

I can't tell you how worried
I was that you had both
died![BRK]

It was horrible...[BRK]

[POR02]
But Lucia...Why did you come
back to find us? You risked
your life...your mission.[BRK]

[POR08]
I came because....
...because...
I.....[BRK]

It makes no sense, but just
before I came to you, I felt
something was wrong.[BRK]

Not wrong in general, but
wrong with Hiro...It was
very strange.[BRK]

When I was alone on the Blue
Star, I never had such
a strange feeling...[BRK]

It was like...like Hiro and
I were one.[BRK]

I've never felt that before.[BRK]

[POR02]
Well, whatever hocus-pocus
called you back to us, I'm
grateful.[BRK]

If you hadn't come, we'd
probably be popsicles by
now.[BRK]

C'mon, let's hurry and find
the others![END]

Oooouuuggggghhhh![BRK]

Man...do I have a king-size
whopper of a headache![BRK]

It's a good thing you guys
found me when you did.[BRK]

...Guess I'm luckier than
I'd thought...[BRK]

[POR02]
Ya got that right![END]

I'm so glad we were able to
find and revive all the
party members.[BRK]

For a while there, I was
frightened at what I might
find.[BRK]

It's strange. I feel like my
heart is relaxing...[BRK]

[POR02]
That's called relief. It's
the opposite of anxiety,
which you felt earlier.[BRK]

[POR08]
Hmmm...'Relief'...I like
this feeling. Hmm...Relief.[END]

[POR10]
Wha...What happened?[BRK]

The...The last thing I
remember was Ruby screaming
as the snow washed over us.[BRK]

I can't believe I'm still
alive! Thank you!

Oh pooh! Look at my dress!
It's absolutely soaked![BRK]

...Wait...There was an
avalanche, wasn't there?[BRK]

How is it that I'm still
alive?[BRK]

[POR02]
It's because Lucia came
back and saved our butts![END]

...Hiro! You can't just
leave the others![END]

We've got to hurry and find
the others before they
freeze to death![END]

The beast must have caused
the avalanche![BRK]

Now that he's destroyed, the
village should have much
better luck with weather![END]
