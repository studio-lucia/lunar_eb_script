Uh...oh...Trouble![BRK]

The Spire guardians have
come to life![BRK]

What are we going to do,
Hiro? We can't beat three
more of these things![END]

Ha! Those guardians are no
match for the power of the
Dragonship Destiny![END]

With the Goddess Althena
providing the power, this
ship is invin...[BRK]

But I have better things
to do than brag about my
ship.[BRK]

Althena has sent me to
capture a destroyer that
has come to our world.[BRK]

And I don't intend to let
her down![BRK]

[POR04]
I still don't see how or
why a destroyer would
come here...[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR04]
N-No...It's not right...
...It must be some sort
of mistake...[BRK]

[POR09]
You have no authority to
doubt me, old man.[BRK]

This destroyer I'm looking
for is in that tower...I'd
bet my life on it.[BRK]

It's my job to smoke it
out and deliver it to
Althena.[BRK]

And if it resists, Althena
has given me authority to
eradicate it.[BRK]

You're out of your league
here. Just go home.[BRK]

[POR02]
Of all the...I can't believe
how rude he is! He works for
Althena?[END]

Say, Hiro, who's the lady?[END]

[POR09]
Hmmm...You're wearing a
strange dress of red cloth.
I've never seen its equal.[BRK]

And you seem to be sick...
...What has made you weak,
girl?[BRK]

[POR02]
It was a monster in the
depths of the tower! It
attacked her![BRK]

We barely escaped. If you
hurry, you may catch it![BRK]

[POR09]
Ha! Exactly as I suspected!
The destroyer is in the
tower![BRK]

C'mon, men, let's go...[END]

[POR02]
He he he! He fell for it![BRK]

That was close...[BRK]

[POR04]
Hurry, kids, we must get
Lucia back to the house.
She's weakening...[BRK]

Maybe then she can tell us
exactly why she needs to
see Althena...[BRK]

And more importantly, how
she expects to find her...[END]
