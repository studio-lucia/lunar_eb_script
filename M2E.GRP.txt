Donated 100s!
[END]

=== 1 | 14322 | 4d ===
[POR02]
Guess what, sphincter boy?[BRK]

The door is locked! Maybe
there's another way..[END]

=== 2 | 14382 | 86 ===
Welcome to Neo-Vane! [BRK]

Behind me lies the new
Magic Guild mansion.[BRK]

It's far better than the
old run-down guild mansion
in ancient Vane.[END]

=== 3 | 14420 | a1 ===
Master Borgan is hard at
work inside the Guild
mansion.[BRK]

However, he's not alone. 
Miria is inside with him.[BRK]

Borgan fancies this his
neo-love-pad.[BRK]

It disgusts me![END]

=== 4 | 144ce | 81 ===
[POR07]
Pooh! Borgan wouldn't
know how to get a woman
if he tried![BRK]

The only reason my mother
is in there is because he
kidnapped her!![END]

=== 5 | 14562 | 84 ===
You know, if you walk by
the house late at night
you can hear strange sounds.[BRK]

I think it's the sound of
his royal obeseness snoring.[END]

=== 6 | 145fa | 53 ===
I don't believe that our
beloved Neo-Vane fell...[BRK]

Is this history repeating
itself?[END]

=== 7 | 14660 | c3 ===
Master Borgan has left here
for ancient Vane.[BRK]

I think he likes spending 
time there with Miria.[BRK]

I just wish he would loan me
the keys to this place.[BRK]

I'm dying to try out the
heart-shaped jacuzzi![END]

=== 8 | 14730 | 53 ===
[POR07]
You know what someone would
pay for a place like this?[BRK]

We're talking major cash![END]

=== 9 | 1479a | 58 ===
There's no one inside this
mansion right now.[BRK]

I wish Borgan would trust
me to house-sit.[END]

=== a | 14806 | aa ===
I just love it here in
Neo-Vane. All those little
peons below serving us.[BRK]

You know, I'm glad I know
how to use magic![BRK]

I couldn't bear to be one
of those miserable slaves![END]

=== b | 148c8 | 76 ===
Those slaves below need to
work harder.[BRK]

Perhaps we can get some
wild dogs to nip at their
heels...[BRK]

...hmmm...yessss...[END]

=== c | 14952 | ed ===
Paradise gained to
paradise lost...[BRK]

That'll be my new book. In 
it I'll tell of my hardships
living in Neo-Vane...[BRK]

And of course, the heart-
stopping finale...[BRK]

In which I tell of the fall
of Neo-Vane.[BRK]

I'm certain it'll be a best-
seller.[END]

=== d | 14a52 | dd ===
Hey, I'm looking to get out
of this dump![BRK]

I was thinking a cute guy
like you might want to take
a girl away from all this.[BRK]

Of course, you'll have to
wait on me hand and foot.[BRK]

But look how beautiful my
hands and feet are!
[END]

=== e | 14b3c | 3b ===
[POR05]
Yer barkin' up the wrong
tree, lady.[BRK]

I'm not into that.
[END]

=== f | 14b8e | 42 ===
Please take me with you. I
really need someone to take
care of me.[END]

=== 10 | 14bde | 32 ===
[POR05]
Perhaps there's a state
program or something...[END]

=== 11 | 14c24 | f7 ===
They always made fun of me
when I was a kid.[BRK]

But I showed them. I learned
magic and the flame spell.[BRK]

They weren't laughin' so
hard when ol' lenny here
flamed 'em![BRK]

Hey, if anyone talks bad
'bout lenny, you let lenny
know.[BRK]

...and lenny'll hurt 'em.
[END]

=== 12 | 14d32 | 97 ===
Lenny's tired of people 
talkin' behind his back.[BRK]

Lenny's gonna learn new 
magic and hurt 'em bad.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm getting the impression
that lenny's mental...[END]

=== 13 | 14ddc | 35 ===
Lenny's learnin' how to
read. Then lenny'll be
smart![END]

=== 14 | 14e20 | 113 ===
Lenny's found a new magic.
It's called 'magic of boom!'[BRK]

If'n anyone says bad things
'bout lenny, lenny'll use
his new magic on them.[BRK]

But I'd never use it on
your flyin' bunny.[BRK]

Say, mister, can I pet it?[BRK]

[POR02]
First I'm a flying cat.
Now I'm a flying bunny.
Sheesh, what's next?
[END]

=== 15 | 14f40 | 48 ===
[POR07]
This is exactly the sort of
person that we would never
allow in Vane.[END]

=== 16 | 14f9c | e0 ===
I can't believe they let me
in here. I don't even know
how to use magic.[BRK]

All I did when I filled out
my questionnaire was mark
'practicing sage.'[BRK]

That's all it took. They
didn't even do a background
check on me! Go figure...[END]

=== 17 | 1508a | 10 ===
[POR05]
What? No way![END]

=== 18 | 150b2 | 45 ===
Look at this! I got free
pens, notepads, and
shampoo from the inn.


[END]

=== 19 | 1510a | 5f ===
I...i...i...i...i...i
don't...don't...li...
like...falling![BRK]

[POR02]
Geez, we didn't fall that
far.

[END]

=== 1a | 1517c | bb ===
I've learned a valuable 
lesson: don't ever lie on
entrance exams...[BRK]

This was a sign from the
Goddess. I could've been
killed when Neo-Vane fell.[BRK]

Fortunately, someone up
there likes me...[END]

=== 1b | 15244 | 59 ===
[POR05]
Yes, and she commanded
that you should surrender
all your money to me.[BRK]

Fork it over...[END]

=== 1c | 152b4 | 3a ===
You know, Borgan sure has
turned into a really nice
guy...[END]

=== 1d | 152fc | 34 ===
[POR07]
Pooh! Nice guy, my foot!
I still don't trust him![END]

=== 1e | 15344 | e5 ===
Borgan has proven that even
humans can harness the power
of the Goddess.[BRK]

He has made the magic city
of Neo-Vane float high above
the world of Lunar.[BRK]

[POR08]
It is impossible for humans
to contain that power.[BRK]

Borgan's power is corrupt![END]

=== 1f | 15440 | 4c ===
You know, if I play my 
cards right, maybe Borgan
will let me stay for free.[END]

=== 20 | 154a0 | 69 ===
I guess Borgan didn't have
any special power.[BRK]

Turns out he was just
leechin' power off the Black
Dragon.
[END]

=== 21 | 15518 | c6 ===
I just heard that humans 
were able to destroy the god
of destruction.[BRK]

I wonder if humans have the
strongest power of all?[BRK]

[POR02]
To have real power, you
should become a dragon![BRK]

That's true power, baby![END]

=== 22 | 155f2 | 10d ===
Lord Zophar is the future of
this world.[BRK]

Althena is so last week.[BRK]

Come on! Who needs a goddess
who cares about song and
dance?[BRK]

That stuff's for chicks and
fairies...[BRK]

[POR08]
You ignorant fool![BRK]

You have no idea what you're
saying![BRK]

Zophar's only goal is to
destroy this world![END]

=== 23 | 15716 | 6c ===
I know that Lord Zophar is
a god of war, and we should
all worship his godliness.[BRK]

[POR08]
You are so misguided...[END]

=== 24 | 15796 | 4d ===
Why has Neo-Vane fallen?
Aaahhh!!![BRK]

What have I done to make
Zophar so angry!?[END]

=== 25 | 157f2 | 82 ===
Oh no! I didn't realize 
that I was worshipping
an evil god.[BRK]

I must be the reason Neo-
Vane fell from the sky![BRK]

I feel so...dirty!
[END]

=== 26 | 15888 | f2 ===
I heard that Miria has left
ancient Vane to be near
Borgan here in Neo-Vane.[BRK]

I'm glad she left. She 
doesn't deserve to live
in that decrepit place.[BRK]

[POR07]
Vane isn't worn out! It's
just a little...neglected.[BRK]

Pretty soon, it'll be as
good as new![END]

=== 27 | 15992 | 6b ===
I love it here in Neo-Vane.
This place is so grand.[BRK]

I'm so glad that I don't
have to live in ancient 
Vane.[END]

=== 28 | 15a10 | 50 ===
I can't believe that 
Neo-Vane has fallen.[BRK]

This has just totally
ruined my week.[END]

=== 29 | 15a70 | 7f ===
I don't understand why
Borgan is always going
to ancient Vane.[BRK]

Maybe he just likes living
there surrounded by all that
history.[END]

=== 2a | 15afc | 6b ===
[POR07]
Now that we know that my
Magic Guild is the right
one,[BRK]

I'm gonna drop Borgan from
the membership roster.[END]

=== 2b | 15b7a | 106 ===
I heard that Borgan is about
to marry.[BRK]

The rumor is that it's going
to be Miria, the former
premier of the Magic Guild.[BRK]

When Borgan stands next to
Miria, it kinda looks like
beauty and the beast.[BRK]

[POR07]
Yeah, well, I won't let that
pig lay a hand on my
mother!





[END]

=== 2c | 15c98 | 7d ===
Wedding bells have already
begun to ring for Borgan
and Miria.[BRK]

[POR07]
No! No! Don't say that![BRK]

I won't let my mother marry
Borgan![END]

=== 2d | 15d28 | 70 ===
Did you hear?[BRK]

We're gonna have to
postpone Borgan's wedding...[BRK]

All this turmoil has really
screwed up this town![END]

=== 2e | 15da6 | 2b ===
[POR07]
That's the best news I've
heard all day![END]

=== 2f | 15de0 | 5a ===
Borgan now resides in
ancient Vane.[BRK]

I think he's going there
because Miria loves it
there.[END]

=== 30 | 15e48 | 38 ===
[POR07]
When I get back there,
I'm gonna boot that
loser out![END]

=== 31 | 15e94 | a7 ===
I'm so glad that I passed
the test![BRK]

Now I'm free to roam amongst
the elite of Neo-Vane.[BRK]

If I apply myself, all my
dreams should come true.[BRK]

[POR02]
Shyeah...keep dreaming...[END]

=== 32 | 15f52 | 3b ===
My life is going to be so
easy once I complete my
training.[END]

=== 33 | 15fa4 | 50 ===
Why did Neo-Vane have to
fall?[BRK]

My life is ruined. Ruined,
I say! Ohhh, why me???[END]

=== 34 | 16002 | d0 ===
[POR07]
Maybe you should come to
Vane. I'll let you study
magic there...[BRK]

[POR00]
Vane!? No way! The premier
of the Guild is stingy and
only interested in money.[BRK]

[POR07]
That's not true!! Who told
you that? I demand to
know![END]

=== 35 | 160ee | 89 ===
I can't wait to go to Vane.[BRK]

There's no elitist power-
trips going on there.[BRK]

It's my kind of place...[BRK]

[POR02]
Talk about changing your
story...[END]

=== 36 | 16186 | 8f ===
I tried to get into Vane's 
Magic Guild, but the
entrance fee was too high...[BRK]

The leader of the Guild is
only interested in cold,
hard cash...
[END]

=== 37 | 16222 | 76 ===
[POR07]
Pooh! I'm glad you couldn't
afford to get in the Guild![BRK]

With an attitude like that,
I don't even want you in
Vane!![END]

=== 38 | 162ac | 70 ===
I thought I was going to 
enjoy it here in Vane.[BRK]

But these people are so 
stuck up you can't even
talk to them.
[END]

=== 39 | 16334 | 8d ===
Hey, I'm talkin' to you![BRK]

You know, you're just like
everyone else here.[BRK]

Think you're something
special just 'cause you
know how to use magic.[END]

=== 3a | 163d8 | 7e ===
Yeah! That'll teach these
stuck-up weenies!![BRK]

This is the best thing to 
ever happen here. I'm glad
Neo-Vane fell from the sky![END]

=== 3b | 16472 | 54 ===
You should see these people
walk around here wallowing 
in self-pity.[BRK]

It's pathetic.[END]

=== 3c | 164d6 | b6 ===
I hope that all these people
realize they're now losers,
just like me.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm certain that no one can
be as big a loser as you.[BRK]

I'm sure beck had you in
mind when he wrote that
song![END]

=== 3d | 165a0 | 73 ===
Down with Neo-Vane!
Down with Neo-Vane![BRK]

Neo-Vane will crash just
like Vane![BRK]

Down with Neo-Vane!
Down with Neo-Vane![END]

=== 3e | 1662a | 4b ===
If I were you, I would get
out of Neo-Vane before
it crashes to the ground.[END]

=== 3f | 1668c | 90 ===
I'm seeking donations to
help the less-fortunate...[BRK]

Evacuate Neo-Vane before
the big crash.[BRK]

If you donate, you'll get 
a free hat and t-shirt...[END]

=== 40 | 1672a | 6c ===
[POR07]
I don't think so, buster.[BRK]

My Silver is too precious
to give to your nutty
cause![BRK]

[POR02]
I can vouch for that![END]

=== 41 | 167b2 | 24 ===
Ha! I told you Neo-Vane
would crash![END]

=== 42 | 167e6 | ab ===
See, I told you Neo-Vane
was going to fall from the
sky![BRK]

You should have donated to
my cause.[BRK]

I would've given you some 
of the credit for warning
people of the disaster. [END]

=== 43 | 1689e | 48 ===
[POR07]
Give it a rest, buster![BRK]

No one really cares about
what you're saying.[END]

=== 44 | 168fa | 151 ===
When I was at dinner with 
Borgan. I gazed into his
eyes. [BRK]

His eyes were dark. Dark as
night. They consumed me.
I was drawn toward them.[BRK]

I did not see hatred in
those eyes, only love.[BRK]

Love that's deeper than a
thousand oceans.[BRK]

Love that's warmer than a
hundred suns.[BRK]

Love that is all-consuming.[BRK]

You know, he's really not
what he seems...[END]

=== 45 | 16a62 | 11c ===
At the table, I dared not
move for he had the look
of all-consuming passion.[BRK]

Passion for sweetcakes, for
cupcakes, for pork, for
berries, cream, and wine.[BRK]

It was amazing, and, at the
same time, terrifying.[BRK]

I was afraid that if I
moved, he'd grab my arm by
mistake and start gnawing...[END]

=== 46 | 16b96 | e8 ===
Borgan has a power. Power
that draws the weak toward
him.[BRK]

I know that I cannot escape
his stare. For those eyes
draw me closer still.[BRK]

I want to resist, but I need
to know his love...[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh...I'm thinkin' that
you need to get a life![END]

=== 47 | 16c9a | 83 ===
Why? Why does he tease me
this way? Borgan knows that
I will always follow him.[BRK]

And yet, my love goes
unrequited.[BRK]

I'm so depressed.[END]

=== 48 | 16d2c | a4 ===
I miss those eyes. Those
eyes of Borgan's.[BRK]

Oh, how I used to love to
gaze into those deep pools
of silken blackness...[BRK]

Yet that chance shall never
again be mine...
[END]

=== 49 | 16de4 | a6 ===
I'm getting sick of hearing
how great and wonderful 
Borgan is.[BRK]

Trust me, don't talk to
that lady over there...[BRK]

She's nuts about him. We're
talkin' way over the edge![END]

=== 4a | 16ea2 | a4 ===
I'm thinking that if I'm
lucky,[BRK]

that woman who's nuts for
Borgan will fall off the
edge of Neo-Vane.[BRK]

I'm sure glad our little
world isn't round. It
gives me hope...[END]

=== 4b | 16f5e | 54 ===
I guess Borgan isn't that
powerful.[BRK]

He can't even keep the city
he built in the sky![END]

=== 4c | 16fc0 | 72 ===
[POR07]
Exactly! That's what I've
been trying to tell you 
people...[BRK]

Borgan's power is a joke![BRK]

He's a fraudulent leech![END]

=== 4d | 1704e | 75 ===
I guess Borgan really wasn't
interested in furthering the
cause of the Magic Guild.[BRK]

He was only after fame and
power.[END]

=== 4e | 170d4 | 37 ===
[POR10]
His thirst for power has
been his problem all along![END]

=== 4f | 1711e | 52 ===
I'm glad Borgan left here.
Now I don't have to listen
to that crazy chick anymore.[END]

=== 50 | 17184 | 135 ===
Eesaka, na-cha-locho
moze-no-lay, tobontano,
leechy-mucho...[BRK]

I'm practicing casting magic
spells. Didn't that just 
give you the creeps?[BRK]

Even if I don't know how to
cast a spell...[BRK]

People will be scared when 
they hear me chant something
like that.[BRK]

And whooo! Just wait 'til
halloween![BRK]

Spoookkyy! He he he...
[END]

=== 51 | 172d0 | 122 ===
They say that some stupid
girl is trying to revive
the old Magic Guild.[BRK]

Doesn't she know that it's
a waste of time? Borgan is
in control now.[BRK]

[POR07]
Don't worry. Sooner or later
you'll come beggin' to be a
part of ancient Vane.[BRK]

That's when you're really
gonna have to pay![BRK]

Ooough, will you pay![END]

=== 52 | 17406 | 6b ===
I can't believe that I was
fooled by Borgan...[BRK]

His true power is not much
greater than mine![BRK]

What a loser!![END]

=== 53 | 17480 | 8a ===
I heard that Borgan has
abandoned us...[BRK]

He's more interested in 
spending time with Miria.[BRK]

[POR02]
Shush! Don't say that![BRK]

Lemina will flip out![END]

=== 54 | 1751e | d9 ===
This really sucks! That
stupid kid has more magic
power than me.[BRK]

They say he's some sort of
child prodigy![BRK]

I think the mouthy little 
brat needs a good, hard 
whippin'![BRK]

I'm practicing the magic of
spank, just in case.[END]

=== 55 | 1760e | 77 ===
I've been studying all day
and night.[BRK]

Finally, I think I'm gonna
be smarter than that kid.[BRK]

[POR02]
Keep dreamin', no-brains![END]

=== 56 | 17696 | a2 ===
[POR10]
Ruby, one will only be as
intelligent as one wishes
to become. [BRK]

[POR02]
That sounds like some of
that self-help mumbo-jumbo![BRK]

Sorry, I don't subscribe.[BRK]

[POR07]
....
.....[END]

=== 57 | 17750 | 6f ===
Crap!! Now that Neo-Vane 
has crashed to the ground,[BRK]

I'll never be able to show
that kid how smart I've
become.[END]

=== 58 | 177ce | 9a ===
I've decided that I don't
need magic to be better
than that kid...[BRK]

I'm just gonna sneak up on
him and cast the magic of
spank.[BRK]

I've got it all worked out![END]

=== 59 | 1787c | b7 ===
I love it here in Neo-Vane!
See that simpleton over 
there?[BRK]

I've toasted his butt with
the new magic spell I
learned yesterday.[BRK]

All he can do is curse me,
'cause his magic is so weak![END]

=== 5a | 1794a | 8a ===
Last night I told him to 
chant this one spell...[BRK]

And he turned himself into
a pig![BRK]

For a while, we had two pigs
in Neo-Vane! Ha ha ha ha![END]

=== 5b | 179e8 | 87 ===
I've found my true calling
here in Neo-Vane.[BRK]

I must master the magic of
excessive boogers.[BRK]

If I can just do it, I know
it'll be a riot![END]

=== 5c | 17a7e | 6f ===
That man over there has been
carving something out of
wood.[BRK]

Do you think you could find
out what he's planning?[END]

=== 5d | 17afa | 3c ===
[POR05]
I know what he's planning,
and I'm coming back to 
watch![END]

=== 5e | 17b4a | bd ===
You know I really think 
Borgan is trying hard to
lose some weight.[BRK]

He says there's a thin
person inside just waiting
to get out.[BRK]

[POR07]
I think there are several
thin people trying to get
out![END]

=== 5f | 17c1e | 4a ===
I wish Borgan would try my
new diet plan. I've lost
62 pounds in one week![END]

=== 60 | 17c7c | 75 ===
I don't think Borgan is
concerned about losing
weight anymore.[BRK]

Why should he? He already
has the woman of his dreams.[END]

=== 61 | 17d00 | 63 ===
Since I've lost so much
weight, all the guys keep
asking me out...[BRK]

I think I'm going to be a
model.[END]

=== 62 | 17d70 | 66 ===
[POR05]
I'd like to sign you up
to attend my new modeling
school![BRK]

We'll talk about the 
entrance fee later![END]

=== 63 | 17dea | b6 ===
I was torn away from my wife
and two kids once it was 
discovered that I had magic.[BRK]

I'm a prisoner here in Neo-
Vane.[BRK]

I live a life of ease while
my family are prisoners in
the mine![END]

=== 64 | 17eb8 | 5a ===
How can I practice magic?[BRK]

All of my thoughts are 
focused on the well-being 
of my family![END]

=== 65 | 17f26 | 63 ===
Now that Neo-Vane has 
become a failure, I'm
leaving.[BRK]

I can't wait to get home to
my wife and kids.[END]

=== 66 | 17f98 | 6f ===
This is my last day in Neo-
Vane. I'm leaving tonight
to go home.[BRK]

And I just can't wait to
see the kids again!
[END]

=== 67 | 1801a | a3 ===
Borgan, Borgan, he's our
man. If he can't eat it,
no one can![BRK]

You should have seen it here
last week.[BRK]

We had a food eating
contest. Borgan dwarfed the
competition![END]

=== 68 | 180d4 | 46 ===
Miria should be happy that
she's getting someone like
Borgan to marry.[END]

=== 69 | 1812e | 3d ===
I'm glad that the fall of 
Neo-Vane wasn't really that
bad...[END]

=== 6a | 1817a | 93 ===
I've survived the crash.
I've lived through most
of this life without pain.[BRK]

But I'm getting too old
for all this stuff.[BRK]

Stop the ride. I want off.

You've been selected to

What do you mean 'selected?'
What's happening to Ronfar
and Jean?[BRK]

[POR00]
My duty is to send those
incompetent people back to
the mines.[BRK]

They don't belong here. They
are common folk.[END]

How did you get back to
Neo-Vane?[BRK]

I'm going to call the

They'll take care of you![END]

The two-timers have come

Neo-vane has really gone

I'm trying to find some
way to get out of this

I can't believe they allowed
the children from the mine

I'm tired of playing
playground attendant for
these brats![END]

[POR10]
Hey! What's happening?[BRK]

Ronfar! They've got us
suspended in mid-air![BRK]

[POR05]
Whooa! Somehow I don't think
this means we passed.[BRK]

I just wonder what's down
there.[BRK]

[POR00]
Neo-Vane is no place for
people like you to live.[BRK]

You're sentenced to a life
toiling away in Zaback Mine![BRK]

Good riddance![END]

Those two don't belong
here in Neo-Vane.[BRK]

They knew the risk when
they submitted to the
test.[BRK]

I don't know why people
think that they can enter
this city without magic.[BRK]

I guess you always get those
types that just want
something they can't have.[BRK]

Pathetic, isn't it?[BRK]

Well, anyway, enjoy your

If you won't give up the
Black Dragon Aura willingly,
I'll be forced to take it![BRK]

[POR17]
Oh, honey, you didn't
think it would be that
easy, did you?[BRK]

I have no intention of
giving up this utopia I've
created.[BRK]

If I give you the Black
Dragon Aura, I will lose all
I have created.[BRK]

And that would be a pity,
don't you think?[BRK]

[POR07]
The only pity would be
letting you continue with
this mega-farce![BRK]

Your rule is nothing more
than a sham, built on the
power of the Black Dragon.[BRK]

I intend to show that to
the world.[BRK]

[POR17]
I wouldn't expect anything
less from you, dumpling.[BRK]

I've been itching to try
out my new Gravity Bomb
spell.[BRK]

And you and your pathetic
friends will be the perfect

I'm certain you'll find it
quite...impressive.[BRK]

Just as he lost the power

Borgan will lose his.[BRK]

His defeat is absolute.[BRK]

[POR07]
What are you talking about,
Lucia?[BRK]

[POR08]
Borgan's magic power was
entirely dependent on
possession of the aura.[BRK]

Without it, he is unable
to harness the power of
the Black Dragon.[BRK]

[POR07]
If that's true, then
Neo-Vane's very existence
is in jeopardy.[BRK]

You're all that I have left.

If Borgan has caused you any
pain, I'll make him pay 
ten-fold in misery![BRK]

[POR22]
No, my dear, Borgan treated
me like royalty.[BRK]

Just take a look over there.
See! He's spoiled me rotten
with all of these gifts.[BRK]

I told him that I would
never accept anything from
him, but he didn't listen.[BRK]

Without me, there is no way

Dragon's power.[BRK]

So what will you do now,

If you want to save your

Will you live with the blood
of all these people on your

No, of course you can't,

Now, give me the Black
Dragon's aura before it's

This isn't the end of the
dream. It's the beginning.[BRK]

Neo-Vane was never the
rightful place for the Magic
Guild.[BRK]

Now I can concentrate on
rebuilding ancient Vane to
its former glory.[BRK]

I have the responsibility to
help everyone who wants to
learn magic to do so.[BRK]

It doesn't matter if you 
are able to use magic or 
not, Borgan.[BRK]

Now is the time to put aside
any past differences.[BRK]

If you'll renounce your
former ways, I'd be happy
to let you join us.[BRK]

[POR17]

Lemina, you are too kind.[BRK]

I don't belong in a world

something...[BRK]

The guild has no money,

This place is far superior
to ancient Vane in every
way...[BRK]

I've got a joke for you. How
do you stop the leader of
