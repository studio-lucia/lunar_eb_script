Donated 100s!
[END]

=== 1 | 14322 | 4d ===
[POR02]
Guess what, sphincter boy?[BRK]

The door is locked! Maybe
there's another way..[END]

=== 2 | 14382 | 86 ===
Welcome to neo-vane! [BRK]

Behind me lies the new
magic guild mansion.[BRK]

It's far better than the
old run-down guild mansion
in ancient vane.[END]

=== 3 | 14420 | a1 ===
Master borgan is hard at
work inside the guild
mansion.[BRK]

However, he's not alone. 
Miria is inside with him.[BRK]

Borgan fancies this his
neo-love-pad.[BRK]

It disgusts me![END]

=== 4 | 144ce | 81 ===
[POR07]
Pooh! Borgan wouldn't
know how to get a woman
if he tried![BRK]

The only reason my mother
is in there is because he
kidnapped her!![END]

=== 5 | 14562 | 84 ===
You know, if you walk by
the house late at night
you can hear strange sounds.[BRK]

I think it's the sound of
his royal obeseness snoring.[END]

=== 6 | 145fa | 53 ===
I don't believe that our
beloved neo-vane fell...[BRK]

Is this history repeating
itself?[END]

=== 7 | 14660 | c3 ===
Master borgan has left here
for ancient vane.[BRK]

I think he likes spending 
time there with miria.[BRK]

I just wish he would loan me
the keys to this place.[BRK]

I'm dying to try out the
heart-shaped jacuzzi![END]

=== 8 | 14730 | 53 ===
[POR07]
You know what someone would
pay for a place like this?[BRK]

We're talking major cash![END]

=== 9 | 1479a | 58 ===
There's no one inside this
mansion right now.[BRK]

I wish borgan would trust
me to house-sit.[END]

=== a | 14806 | aa ===
I just love it here in
neo-vane. All those little
peons below serving us.[BRK]

You know, i'm glad i know
how to use magic![BRK]

I couldn't bear to be one
of those miserable slaves![END]

=== b | 148c8 | 76 ===
Those slaves below need to
work harder.[BRK]

Perhaps we can get some
wild dogs to nip at their
heels...[BRK]

...hmmm...yessss...[END]

=== c | 14952 | ed ===
Paradise gained to
paradise lost...[BRK]

That'll be my new book. In 
it i'll tell of my hardships
living in neo-vane...[BRK]

And of course, the heart-
stopping finale...[BRK]

In which i tell of the fall
of neo-vane.[BRK]

I'm certain it'll be a best-
seller.[END]

=== d | 14a52 | dd ===
Hey, i'm looking to get out
of this dump![BRK]

I was thinking a cute guy
like you might want to take
a girl away from all this.[BRK]

Of course, you'll have to
wait on me hand and foot.[BRK]

But look how beautiful my
hands and feet are!
[END]

=== e | 14b3c | 3b ===
[POR05]
Yer barkin' up the wrong
tree, lady.[BRK]

I'm not into that.
[END]

=== f | 14b8e | 42 ===
Please take me with you. I
really need someone to take
care of me.[END]

=== 10 | 14bde | 32 ===
[POR05]
Perhaps there's a state
program or something...[END]

=== 11 | 14c24 | f7 ===
They always made fun of me
when i was a kid.[BRK]

But i showed them. I learned
magic and the flame spell.[BRK]

They weren't laughin' so
hard when ol' lenny here
flamed 'em![BRK]

Hey, if anyone talks bad
'bout lenny, you let lenny
know.[BRK]

...and lenny'll hurt 'em.
[END]

=== 12 | 14d32 | 97 ===
Lenny's tired of people 
talkin' behind his back.[BRK]

Lenny's gonna learn new 
magic and hurt 'em bad.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm getting the impression
that lenny's mental...[END]

=== 13 | 14ddc | 35 ===
Lenny's learnin' how to
read. Then lenny'll be
smart![END]

=== 14 | 14e20 | 113 ===
Lenny's found a new magic.
It's called 'magic of boom!'[BRK]

If'n anyone says bad things
'bout lenny, lenny'll use
his new magic on them.[BRK]

But i'd never use it on
your flyin' bunny.[BRK]

Say, mister, can i pet it?[BRK]

[POR02]
First i'm a flying cat.
Now i'm a flying bunny.
Sheesh, what's next?
[END]

=== 15 | 14f40 | 48 ===
[POR07]
This is exactly the sort of
person that we would never
allow in vane.[END]

=== 16 | 14f9c | e0 ===
I can't believe they let me
in here. I don't even know
how to use magic.[BRK]

All i did when i filled out
my questionnaire was mark
'practicing sage.'[BRK]

That's all it took. They
didn't even do a background
check on me! Go figure...[END]

=== 17 | 1508a | 10 ===
[POR05]
What? No way![END]

=== 18 | 150b2 | 45 ===
Look at this! I got free
pens, notepads, and
shampoo from the inn.


[END]

=== 19 | 1510a | 5f ===
I...i...i...i...i...i
don't...don't...li...
like...falling![BRK]

[POR02]
Geez, we didn't fall that
far.

[END]

=== 1a | 1517c | bb ===
I've learned a valuable 
lesson: don't ever lie on
entrance exams...[BRK]

This was a sign from the
goddess. I could've been
killed when neo-vane fell.[BRK]

Fortunately, someone up
there likes me...[END]

=== 1b | 15244 | 59 ===
[POR05]
Yes, and she commanded
that you should surrender
all your money to me.[BRK]

Fork it over...[END]

=== 1c | 152b4 | 3a ===
You know, borgan sure has
turned into a really nice
guy...[END]

=== 1d | 152fc | 34 ===
[POR07]
Pooh! Nice guy, my foot!
I still don't trust him![END]

=== 1e | 15344 | e5 ===
Borgan has proven that even
humans can harness the power
of the goddess.[BRK]

He has made the magic city
of neo-vane float high above
the world of lunar.[BRK]

[POR08]
It is impossible for humans
to contain that power.[BRK]

Borgan's power is corrupt![END]

=== 1f | 15440 | 4c ===
You know, if i play my 
cards right, maybe borgan
will let me stay for free.[END]

=== 20 | 154a0 | 69 ===
I guess borgan didn't have
any special power.[BRK]

Turns out he was just
leechin' power off the black
dragon.
[END]

=== 21 | 15518 | c6 ===
I just heard that humans 
were able to destroy the god
of destruction.[BRK]

I wonder if humans have the
strongest power of all?[BRK]

[POR02]
To have real power, you
should become a dragon![BRK]

That's true power, baby![END]

=== 22 | 155f2 | 10d ===
Lord zophar is the future of
this world.[BRK]

Althena is so last week.[BRK]

Come on! Who needs a goddess
who cares about song and
dance?[BRK]

That stuff's for chicks and
fairies...[BRK]

[POR08]
You ignorant fool![BRK]

You have no idea what you're
saying![BRK]

Zophar's only goal is to
destroy this world![END]

=== 23 | 15716 | 6c ===
I know that lord zophar is
a god of war, and we should
all worship his godliness.[BRK]

[POR08]
You are so misguided...[END]

=== 24 | 15796 | 4d ===
Why has neo-vane fallen?
Aaahhh!!![BRK]

What have i done to make
zophar so angry!?[END]

=== 25 | 157f2 | 82 ===
Oh no! I didn't realize 
that i was worshipping
an evil god.[BRK]

I must be the reason neo-
vane fell from the sky![BRK]

I feel so...dirty!
[END]

=== 26 | 15888 | f2 ===
I heard that miria has left
ancient vane to be near
borgan here in neo-vane.[BRK]

I'm glad she left. She 
doesn't deserve to live
in that decrepit place.[BRK]

[POR07]
Vane isn't worn out! It's
just a little...neglected.[BRK]

Pretty soon, it'll be as
good as new![END]

=== 27 | 15992 | 6b ===
I love it here in neo-vane.
This place is so grand.[BRK]

I'm so glad that i don't
have to live in ancient 
vane.[END]

=== 28 | 15a10 | 50 ===
I can't believe that 
neo-vane has fallen.[BRK]

This has just totally
ruined my week.[END]

=== 29 | 15a70 | 7f ===
I don't understand why
borgan is always going
to ancient vane.[BRK]

Maybe he just likes living
there surrounded by all that
history.[END]

=== 2a | 15afc | 6b ===
[POR07]
Now that we know that my
magic guild is the right
one,[BRK]

i'm gonna drop borgan from
the membership roster.[END]

=== 2b | 15b7a | 106 ===
I heard that borgan is about
to marry.[BRK]

The rumor is that it's going
to be miria, the former
premier of the magic guild.[BRK]

When borgan stands next to
miria, it kinda looks like
beauty and the beast.[BRK]

[POR07]
Yeah, well, i won't let that
pig lay a hand on my
mother!





[END]

=== 2c | 15c98 | 7d ===
Wedding bells have already
begun to ring for borgan
and miria.[BRK]

[POR07]
No! No! Don't say that![BRK]

I won't let my mother marry
borgan![END]

=== 2d | 15d28 | 70 ===
Did you hear?[BRK]

We're gonna have to
postpone borgan's wedding...[BRK]

All this turmoil has really
screwed up this town![END]

=== 2e | 15da6 | 2b ===
[POR07]
That's the best news i've
heard all day![END]

=== 2f | 15de0 | 5a ===
Borgan now resides in
ancient vane.[BRK]

I think he's going there
because miria loves it
there.[END]

=== 30 | 15e48 | 38 ===
[POR07]
When i get back there,
i'm gonna boot that
loser out![END]

=== 31 | 15e94 | a7 ===
I'm so glad that i passed
the test![BRK]

Now i'm free to roam amongst
the elite of neo-vane.[BRK]

If i apply myself, all my
dreams should come true.[BRK]

[POR02]
Shyeah...keep dreaming...[END]

=== 32 | 15f52 | 3b ===
My life is going to be so
easy once i complete my
training.[END]

=== 33 | 15fa4 | 50 ===
Why did neo-vane have to
fall?[BRK]

My life is ruined. Ruined,
i say! Ohhh, why me???[END]

=== 34 | 16002 | d0 ===
[POR07]
Maybe you should come to
vane. I'll let you study
magic there...[BRK]

[POR00]
Vane!? No way! The premier
of the guild is stingy and
only interested in money.[BRK]

[POR07]
That's not true!! Who told
you that? I demand to
know![END]

=== 35 | 160ee | 89 ===
I can't wait to go to vane.[BRK]

There's no elitist power-
trips going on there.[BRK]

It's my kind of place...[BRK]

[POR02]
Talk about changing your
story...[END]

=== 36 | 16186 | 8f ===
I tried to get into vane's 
magic guild, but the
entrance fee was too high...[BRK]

The leader of the guild is
only interested in cold,
hard cash...
[END]

=== 37 | 16222 | 76 ===
[POR07]
Pooh! I'm glad you couldn't
afford to get in the guild![BRK]

With an attitude like that,
i don't even want you in
vane!![END]

=== 38 | 162ac | 70 ===
I thought i was going to 
enjoy it here in vane.[BRK]

But these people are so 
stuck up you can't even
talk to them.
[END]

=== 39 | 16334 | 8d ===
Hey, i'm talkin' to you![BRK]

You know, you're just like
everyone else here.[BRK]

Think you're something
special just 'cause you
know how to use magic.[END]

=== 3a | 163d8 | 7e ===
Yeah! That'll teach these
stuck-up weenies!![BRK]

This is the best thing to 
ever happen here. I'm glad
neo-vane fell from the sky![END]

=== 3b | 16472 | 54 ===
You should see these people
walk around here wallowing 
in self-pity.[BRK]

It's pathetic.[END]

=== 3c | 164d6 | b6 ===
I hope that all these people
realize they're now losers,
just like me.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm certain that no one can
be as big a loser as you.[BRK]

I'm sure beck had you in
mind when he wrote that
song![END]

=== 3d | 165a0 | 73 ===
Down with neo-vane!
Down with neo-vane![BRK]

Neo-vane will crash just
like vane![BRK]

Down with neo-vane!
Down with neo-vane![END]

=== 3e | 1662a | 4b ===
If i were you, i would get
out of neo-vane before
it crashes to the ground.[END]

=== 3f | 1668c | 90 ===
I'm seeking donations to
help the less-fortunate...[BRK]

Evacuate neo-vane before
the big crash.[BRK]

If you donate, you'll get 
a free hat and t-shirt...[END]

=== 40 | 1672a | 6c ===
[POR07]
I don't think so, buster.[BRK]

My silver is too precious
to give to your nutty
cause![BRK]

[POR02]
I can vouch for that![END]

=== 41 | 167b2 | 24 ===
Ha! I told you neo-vane
would crash![END]

=== 42 | 167e6 | ab ===
See, i told you neo-vane
was going to fall from the
sky![BRK]

You should have donated to
my cause.[BRK]

I would've given you some 
of the credit for warning
people of the disaster. [END]

=== 43 | 1689e | 48 ===
[POR07]
Give it a rest, buster![BRK]

No one really cares about
what you're saying.[END]

=== 44 | 168fa | 151 ===
When i was at dinner with 
borgan. I gazed into his
eyes. [BRK]

His eyes were dark. Dark as
night. They consumed me.
I was drawn toward them.[BRK]

I did not see hatred in
those eyes, only love.[BRK]

Love that's deeper than a
thousand oceans.[BRK]

Love that's warmer than a
hundred suns.[BRK]

Love that is all-consuming.[BRK]

You know, he's really not
what he seems...[END]

=== 45 | 16a62 | 11c ===
At the table, i dared not
move for he had the look
of all-consuming passion.[BRK]

Passion for sweetcakes, for
cupcakes, for pork, for
berries, cream, and wine.[BRK]

It was amazing, and, at the
same time, terrifying.[BRK]

I was afraid that if I
moved, he'd grab my arm by
mistake and start gnawing...[END]

=== 46 | 16b96 | e8 ===
Borgan has a power. Power
that draws the weak toward
him.[BRK]

I know that i cannot escape
his stare. For those eyes
draw me closer still.[BRK]

I want to resist, but i need
to know his love...[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh...i'm thinkin' that
you need to get a life![END]

=== 47 | 16c9a | 83 ===
Why? Why does he tease me
this way? Borgan knows that
i will always follow him.[BRK]

And yet, my love goes
unrequited.[BRK]

I'm so depressed.[END]

=== 48 | 16d2c | a4 ===
I miss those eyes. Those
eyes of borgan's.[BRK]

Oh, how i used to love to
gaze into those deep pools
of silken blackness...[BRK]

Yet that chance shall never
again be mine...
[END]

=== 49 | 16de4 | a6 ===
I'm getting sick of hearing
how great and wonderful 
borgan is.[BRK]

Trust me, don't talk to
that lady over there...[BRK]

She's nuts about him. We're
talkin' way over the edge![END]

=== 4a | 16ea2 | a4 ===
I'm thinking that if i'm
lucky,[BRK]

that woman who's nuts for
borgan will fall off the
edge of neo-vane.[BRK]

I'm sure glad our little
world isn't round. It
gives me hope...[END]

=== 4b | 16f5e | 54 ===
I guess borgan isn't that
powerful.[BRK]

He can't even keep the city
he built in the sky![END]

=== 4c | 16fc0 | 72 ===
[POR07]
Exactly! That's what i've
been trying to tell you 
people...[BRK]

Borgan's power is a joke![BRK]

He's a fraudulent leech![END]

=== 4d | 1704e | 75 ===
I guess borgan really wasn't
interested in furthering the
cause of the magic guild.[BRK]

He was only after fame and
power.[END]

=== 4e | 170d4 | 37 ===
[POR10]
His thirst for power has
been his problem all along![END]

=== 4f | 1711e | 52 ===
I'm glad borgan left here.
Now i don't have to listen
to that crazy chick anymore.[END]

=== 50 | 17184 | 135 ===
Eesaka, na-cha-locho
moze-no-lay, tobontano,
leechy-mucho...[BRK]

I'm practicing casting magic
spells. Didn't that just 
give you the creeps?[BRK]

Even if i don't know how to
cast a spell...[BRK]

People will be scared when 
they hear me chant something
like that.[BRK]

And whooo! Just wait 'til
halloween![BRK]

Spoookkyy! He he he...
[END]

=== 51 | 172d0 | 122 ===
They say that some stupid
girl is trying to revive
the old magic guild.[BRK]

Doesn't she know that it's
a waste of time? Borgan is
in control now.[BRK]

[POR07]
Don't worry. Sooner or later
you'll come beggin' to be a
part of ancient vane.[BRK]

That's when you're really
gonna have to pay![BRK]

Ooough, will you pay![END]

=== 52 | 17406 | 6b ===
I can't believe that i was
fooled by borgan...[BRK]

His true power is not much
greater than mine![BRK]

What a loser!![END]

=== 53 | 17480 | 8a ===
I heard that borgan has
abandoned us...[BRK]

He's more interested in 
spending time with miria.[BRK]

[POR02]
Shush! Don't say that![BRK]

Lemina will flip out![END]

=== 54 | 1751e | d9 ===
This really sucks! That
stupid kid has more magic
power than me.[BRK]

They say he's some sort of
child prodigy![BRK]

I think the mouthy little 
brat needs a good, hard 
whippin'![BRK]

I'm practicing the magic of
spank, just in case.[END]

=== 55 | 1760e | 77 ===
I've been studying all day
and night.[BRK]

Finally, i think i'm gonna
be smarter than that kid.[BRK]

[POR02]
Keep dreamin', no-brains![END]

=== 56 | 17696 | a2 ===
[POR10]
Ruby, one will only be as
intelligent as one wishes
to become. [BRK]

[POR02]
That sounds like some of
that self-help mumbo-jumbo![BRK]

Sorry, i don't subscribe.[BRK]

[POR07]
....
.....[END]

=== 57 | 17750 | 6f ===
Crap!! Now that neo-vane 
has crashed to the ground,[BRK]

i'll never be able to show
that kid how smart i've
become.[END]

=== 58 | 177ce | 9a ===
I've decided that i don't
need magic to be better
than that kid...[BRK]

I'm just gonna sneak up on
him and cast the magic of
spank.[BRK]

I've got it all worked out![END]

=== 59 | 1787c | b7 ===
I love it here in neo-vane!
See that simpleton over 
there?[BRK]

I've toasted his butt with
the new magic spell I
learned yesterday.[BRK]

All he can do is curse me,
'cause his magic is so weak![END]

=== 5a | 1794a | 8a ===
Last night i told him to 
chant this one spell...[BRK]

And he turned himself into
a pig![BRK]

For a while, we had two pigs
in neo-vane! Ha ha ha ha![END]

=== 5b | 179e8 | 87 ===
I've found my true calling
here in neo-vane.[BRK]

I must master the magic of
excessive boogers.[BRK]

If i can just do it, i know
it'll be a riot![END]

=== 5c | 17a7e | 6f ===
That man over there has been
carving something out of
wood.[BRK]

Do you think you could find
out what he's planning?[END]

=== 5d | 17afa | 3c ===
[POR05]
I know what he's planning,
and i'm coming back to 
watch![END]

=== 5e | 17b4a | bd ===
You know i really think 
borgan is trying hard to
lose some weight.[BRK]

He says there's a thin
person inside just waiting
to get out.[BRK]

[POR07]
I think there are several
thin people trying to get
out![END]

=== 5f | 17c1e | 4a ===
I wish borgan would try my
new diet plan. I've lost
62 pounds in one week![END]

=== 60 | 17c7c | 75 ===
I don't think borgan is
concerned about losing
weight anymore.[BRK]

Why should he? He already
has the woman of his dreams.[END]

=== 61 | 17d00 | 63 ===
Since i've lost so much
weight, all the guys keep
asking me out...[BRK]

I think i'm going to be a
model.[END]

=== 62 | 17d70 | 66 ===
[POR05]
I'd like to sign you up
to attend my new modeling
school![BRK]

We'll talk about the 
entrance fee later![END]

=== 63 | 17dea | b6 ===
I was torn away from my wife
and two kids once it was 
discovered that i had magic.[BRK]

I'm a prisoner here in neo-
vane.[BRK]

I live a life of ease while
my family are prisoners in
the mine![END]

=== 64 | 17eb8 | 5a ===
How can i practice magic?[BRK]

All of my thoughts are 
focused on the well-being 
of my family![END]

=== 65 | 17f26 | 63 ===
Now that neo-vane has 
become a failure, i'm
leaving.[BRK]

I can't wait to get home to
my wife and kids.[END]

=== 66 | 17f98 | 6f ===
This is my last day in neo-
vane. I'm leaving tonight
to go home.[BRK]

And i just can't wait to
see the kids again!
[END]

=== 67 | 1801a | a3 ===
Borgan, borgan, he's our
man. If he can't eat it,
no one can![BRK]

You should have seen it here
last week.[BRK]

We had a food eating
contest. Borgan dwarfed the
competition![END]

=== 68 | 180d4 | 46 ===
Miria should be happy that
she's getting someone like
borgan to marry.[END]

=== 69 | 1812e | 3d ===
I'm glad that the fall of 
neo-vane wasn't really that
bad...[END]

=== 6a | 1817a | 93 ===
I've survived the crash.
I've lived through most
of this life without pain.[BRK]

But i'm getting too old
for all this stuff.[BRK]

Stop the ride. I want off.

What's happening to ronfar

My duty is to send those
incompetent people back to

They don't belong here. They
are common folk.[END]

Hey! What's happening?[BRK]

Ronfar! They've got us

Whooa! Somehow i don't think
this means we passed.[BRK]

I just wonder what's down
there.[BRK]

[POR00]
Neo-vane is no place for

Those two don't belong

They knew the risk when
they submitted to the

I don't know why people
think that they can enter
this city without magic.[BRK]

I guess you always get those
types that just want
something they can't have.[BRK]

Pathetic, isn't it?[BRK]

If you won't give up the
black dragon aura willingly,
i'll be forced to take it![BRK]

[POR17]
Oh, honey, you didn't
think it would be that
easy, did you?[BRK]

I have no intention of
giving up this utopia i've
created.[BRK]

If i give you the black
dragon aura, i will lose all
i have created.[BRK]

And that would be a pity,
don't you think?[BRK]

[POR07]
The only pity would be
letting you continue with
this mega-farce![BRK]

Your rule is nothing more
than a sham, built on the
power of the black dragon.[BRK]

I intend to show that to
the world.[BRK]

[POR17]
I wouldn't expect anything
less from you, dumpling.[BRK]

I've been itching to try
out my new gravity bomb

His defeat is absolute.[BRK]

What are you talking about,

[POR08]
Borgan's magic power was
entirely dependent on
possession of the aura.[BRK]

Without it, he is unable

the black dragon.[BRK]

If that's true, then
neo-vane's very existence

No, my dear, borgan treated
me like royalty.[BRK]

Just take a look over there.
See! He's spoiled me rotten

I told him that i would

Will you live with the blood

No, of course you can't,

This isn't the end of the

Neo-vane was never the
rightful place for the magic
guild.[BRK]

Now i can concentrate on
rebuilding ancient vane to
its former glory.[BRK]

I have the responsibility to
help everyone who wants to
learn magic to do so.[BRK]

It doesn't matter if you 
are able to use magic or 
not, borgan.[BRK]

Now is the time to put aside
any past differences.[BRK]

If you'll renounce your
former ways, i'd be happy

I don't belong in a world
