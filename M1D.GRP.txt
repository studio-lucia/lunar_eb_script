This is meribia. Lunn has a
dojo set up here devoted to
blue dragon karate.[BRK]

I need to check it out.[END]

=== 1 | a202 | 6f ===
Welcome to meribia![BRK]

The most popular sites in
town are ramus' store and
lunn's dojo.[BRK]

Be sure to check them out![END]

=== 2 | a280 | ba ===
Did you come to meribia to
see ramus' wondrous store?[BRK]

Rumor has it that it's been
in his family for over 900
years![BRK]

You know, it's become so
famous, other merchants are
coming to see it![END]

=== 3 | a34c | 4a ===
[POR07]
Hmmm...maybe he can give me
a few marketing tips for the
magic guild...[END]

=== 4 | a3a8 | 81 ===
[POR02]
Hey there, lemina, it looks
like you're gonna lose your
bet with ramus![BRK]

You ready to be his blushing
bride?[BRK]

[POR07]
We'll see...


[END]

=== 5 | a43c | 6e ===
I heard that there are vast
sewers that run under this
city.[BRK]

If you find out where they
are, will you tell me?[END]

=== 6 | a4c2 | aa ===
Why are you talking to me
again? I don't need your
help anymore...[BRK]

I just remembered where the
entrance to the meribian
sewers was.[BRK]

So just get lost. You're
annoying me.
[END]

=== 7 | a580 | bb ===
I was told to look for the
entrance to the sewers of
this city.[BRK]

I've got to find them for
my boss back on taben's
peak.[BRK]

If you saw him, you'd know
why i've got to do it. He's
a dreamboat![END]

=== 8 | a652 | 4a ===
Boo hoo hooo! Ooohhh, where
can that sewer entrance be?
...booo hoo hoo!

[END]

=== 9 | a6ac | 9d ===
With all these people
around, you'd think someone
would know about the sewers![BRK]

I'm getting tired of bugging
everyone i see and getting
the same lame answer!![END]

=== a | a758 | 91 ===
Step right up! Step right on
in! Check out the wonders in
ramus' wonder shop![BRK]

We have unusual items from
the known world! Some are
one-of-a-kind![END]

=== b | a7fc | d4 ===
Come one! Come all! Try out
ramus' latest wonder, the
tunnels of carnage![BRK]

This action-packed thrill
ride will put you face-to-
face with death itself![BRK]

Only you decide the final
outcome. All the monsters
are real![END]

=== c | a8e4 | 6b ===
Will you try your luck with
the tunnels of carnage?[BRK]

I guarantee you'll not find
another attraction like it![END]

=== d | a95e | e6 ===
Looking for a thrill? Be
sure to check out ramus' new
ga-ga go-go girls![BRK]

Fresh from their hot world
tour, now performing three
shows nightly![BRK]

[POR02]
Have we stepped into some
sort of twilight zone
episode?[BRK]

This town is just too
weird![END]

=== e | aa58 | 87 ===
The bandits seen around here
have a hideout on taben's
peak.[BRK]

If you're having trouble
with them, you might want to
talk to master lunn.[END]

=== f | aaf6 | 4c ===
Master lunn is very powerful
in this city. If you have a
problem, go to him.[END]

=== 10 | ab56 | 89 ===
Did you finally meet master
lunn? Weren't you totally
impressed with him?[BRK]

I mean...goddess althena
trusts him most among the
four heroes.[END]

=== 11 | abec | 32 ===
[POR10]
Lunn certainly seems
to be one to be admired...[END]

=== 12 | ac32 | 79 ===
Master lunn left for penta-
gulia a while ago and hasn't
yet returned.[BRK]

Maybe he stopped by the
training grounds at horam.[END]

=== 13 | acba | 11f ===
Say, did you hear the story
of the hero that saved the
world? Isn't it wonderful?[BRK]

I heard that a gambler, a
dancer, a magician, and a
dragon helped.[BRK]

I wish i could meet them.[BRK]

[POR02]
Hehe, uh...funny how these
rumors get started, isn't
it?[BRK]

I actually heard that the
dragon helped the most...
[END]

=== 14 | ade8 | cc ===
In other villages i've heard
althena's cult talking about
a dark god of destruction.[BRK]

I wonder why we never hear
about that here in meribia.[BRK]

Oh well, it doesn't really
matter. Master lunn looks
out for us.[END]

=== 15 | aec8 | 71 ===
Monster attacks have grown
to terrible proportions
lately.[BRK]

I'm so glad that master lunn
can protect us from them.[END]

=== 16 | af48 | b9 ===
You know, there really was
a dark god of destruction![BRK]

His name was zophar. I say
'was' because someone
defeated him.[BRK]

I wonder if master lunn had
something to do with it? I
bet he did...[END]

=== 17 | b010 | 87 ===
Master lunn has a dojo here
in meribia where he teaches
blue dragon karate.[BRK]

If you want to see him, go
now. I think he's still
there...[END]

=== 18 | b0aa | 6b ===
Master lunn isn't at his
dojo right now.[BRK]

He left to visit pentagulia.
Well, at least that's what
i heard...[END]

=== 19 | b124 | 90 ===
Master lunn's dojo has been
very busy lately.[BRK]

Once word got out that a
student of his saved the
world,[BRK]

applications to his dojo
increased 2000%![END]

=== 1a | b1c6 | c0 ===
[POR07]
Jean! Did you hear that?
This is a mega-opportunity![BRK]

If we start a dojo and you
endorse it, we stand to make
a fortune![BRK]

[POR10]
Lemina, lemina, lemina...
i want to go back to
dancing, remember? [END]

=== 1b | b296 | de ===
Ah, welcome! You stand
before master lunn's world
famous dojo.[BRK]

He's a very busy person, but
you're in luck! Today he's
in the dojo training.[BRK]

If you want to talk to him
before he leaves for penta-
gulia, you'd better hurry.[END]

=== 1c | b388 | 73 ===
Oh, i am sorry! Master lunn
isn't here right now.[BRK]

He was called away to
pentagulia unexpectedly
by goddess althena.[END]

=== 1d | b40a | cb ===
I heard that a student of
master lunn's defeated
zophar after a big battle.[BRK]

I think that master lunn
would have had an easier
time, but hey, [BRK]

i guess we shouldn't
complain, eh? After all,
it was a chick![END]

=== 1e | b4e2 | 8a ===
[POR02]
Hey! That's not a very nice
thing to say! Don't you know
that...??[BRK]

[POR10]
It's okay, ruby. It doesn't
bother me. This guy is an
imbecile...[END]

=== 1f | b57c | 95 ===
Master lunn welcomes all who
desire to expand their minds
with new knowledge.[BRK]

If you want to learn the
secrets of blue dragon
karate, visit his dojo.[END]

=== 20 | b628 | 7c ===
Master lunn suddenly left
for pentagulia at the
request of althena herself![BRK]

Of the four heroes, i think
he is the busiest...[END]

=== 21 | b6c0 | 50 ===
Sorry, master lunn isn't
here.[BRK]

He's assisting the goddess
althena in pentagulia.[END]

=== 22 | b720 | 6f ===
Boy, i certainly hope master
lunn returns soon.[BRK]

He's been gone so long, i'm
starting to get a little
worried...[END]

=== 23 | b79e | 73 ===
I came here from my home in
nota to peddle my wares,[BRK]

but now bandits are blocking
the road to vane! What will
i do?[END]

=== 24 | b824 | 7b ===
What? The bandits of taben's
peak have disappeared?[BRK]

Do you know what that means?
Now we can get to vane! This
is fantastic![END]

=== 25 | b8b2 | 89 ===
Haven't you heard? The way
is open and the bandits are
gone![BRK]

Don't bother me now! I've
got to make preparations to
move my wares to vane![END]

=== 26 | b948 | 43 ===
[POR07]
Well, get a move on! And I
hope you offer a magician's
discount![END]

=== 27 | b99e | aa ===
Oh dear, did you hear the
latest rumor?[BRK]

They say there are children
amongst the bandits![BRK]

These days, kids are just
running wild! What they need
is a good spanking, i say![END]

=== 28 | ba60 | d4 ===
You know, the more i hear
about these bandits from
taben's peak,[BRK]

the more paranoid i get!
Say, you're not one of them,
are you?[BRK]

[POR02]
Excuse me? When's the last
time you saw a red flying
bandit? I don't think so...
[END]

=== 29 | bb4c | 81 ===
It seems awfully quiet
around here lately. Have all
the bandits gone away?[BRK]

...or were there ever any 
real bandits to begin with?[END]

=== 2a | bbe8 | 69 ===
Now that the bandits have
disappeared, the rumor mill
has really quieted down.[BRK]

I sorta miss the action...[END]

=== 2b | bc60 | 91 ===
Ever since zophar was
defeated, this place has
been partyville.[BRK]

You know, if i didn't know
better, i'd think this month
was some sort of holiday![END]

=== 2c | bd04 | dc ===
I once heard that ramus'
store used to have an outlet
in every town.[BRK]

But the current owner's dad
hit hard times and had to 
close all but this store.[BRK]

If things don't turn around
soon, he may have to close
this one, too.
[END]

=== 2d | bdf8 | 62 ===
I heard that the last
dragonmaster used to love
shopping at ramus'.[BRK]

Seems kinda weird, doesn't
it?[END]

=== 2e | be6e | f5 ===
Whoo hoo! I just tried out
the tunnels of carnage![BRK]

That has got to be the best
ride ramus ever made![BRK]

Look at this![BRK]

See?!...see?! That's real
blood!...my blood![BRK]

I barely escaped with my
life!...what a total
rush! Ha ha ha ha ha![BRK]

Whooo hoooooo!


[END]

=== 2f | bf72 | 93 ===
I think tunnels of carnage
has been such a success that
ramus can expand again.[BRK]

Maybe he can build it back
into a worldwide chain like
it once was.[END]

=== 30 | c018 | dd ===
Master lunn teaches us not
only the ways of blue dragon
karate, but good health.[BRK]

Even though i'm quite old,
i'm still in fantastic
shape.[BRK]

See...feel my butt! Hard as
a rock and soft as a baby's!
You can't buy that, kiddo![END]

=== 31 | c10c | 67 ===
Lunn taught me discipline.
Thanks to him, i have buns
of iron.[BRK]

I can bend steel bars with
these babies![END]

=== 32 | c182 | a3 ===
I wish lunn would come back
soon! I need his guidance to
stick with my program.[BRK]

I think i've started
slipping.[BRK]

Yesterday, i lusted for a
ding-dong.[BRK]

I'm so ashamed.[END]

=== 33 | c238 | 7a ===
Say there, you guys fought
any big monsters?[BRK]

You did!!? Say, how'd you
escape? You look too wimpy
to beat 'em in a fight..[END]

=== 34 | c2ca | 79 ===
My dad just bought me a g.I.
Lunn with the kung-fu grip![BRK]

I'm so excited! Now i can
practice being one of the
four heroes![END]

=== 35 | c352 | 67 ===
Master lunn said he was
going to horam to make his
karate stronger.[BRK]

Man, i wish i was as cool
as him...[END]

=== 36 | c3cc | 63 ===
Haiiii...yaaaaaaa![BRK]

How did that look? I'm
practicing my form so master
lunn will agree to train me![END]

=== 37 | c446 | 2d ===
Oooouuhhhhhh! Wahhhhh! Ha!
Haiiiiiii...yaaaa![END]

=== 38 | c486 | 9b ===
I'm tired of playing master
of the four heroes. Wanna
make a new game?[BRK]

My friend told me about one
called 'doctor' that sounds
fun. Do ya know how to play?[END]

=== 39 | c538 | 83 ===
Hey! I know what game we can
play! Let's play 'world
warriors!'[BRK]

We need five people. I'll
play the drunken priest.[BRK]

Who will you be?[END]

=== 3a | c5c8 | 41 ===
[POR05]
Hey squirt, you're really
pushing your luck today,
aren't you?[END]

=== 3b | c61c | 81 ===
Haaa! I am white knight leo!
Halt in the name of goddess
althena![BRK]

If you do not, i will have
to flail your rank bottom,
stranger![END]

=== 3c | c6b4 | a2 ===
Halt!
     Halt!
          Halt![BRK]

...ahhhhhh! Come back here,
cretin! I have a warrant for
your arrest![BRK]

Don't you know who i am?
I am white knight leo,
greatest...[END]

=== 3d | c76a | 4a ===
I want a new game to play!
We've already played white
knight leo to death![END]

=== 3e | c7c8 | bd ===
If you don't have any new
ideas for games to play, I
guess i'll play leo again![BRK]

......ha! Halt there,
stranger, or i'll crush you
with my kung-fu grip![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Leo is so completely cool![END]

=== 3f | c892 | 1b ===
[POR09]
....
uh, right, kid...

[END]

=== 40 | c8c0 | 4e ===
Cower before me, dung eaters!
I'm red priest mauri, most
powerful in the land![END]

=== 41 | c926 | 78 ===
Hahahahahahaa...[BRK]

Whooooooooo!
Ahhhhhhhhhh![BRK]

I said cower before me!
Are you deaf and stupid?![BRK]

Don't you know who i am?!!
[END]

=== 42 | c9b2 | 4e ===
I like playing mauri. She's
so powerful i can imagine
doing almost anything...[END]

=== 43 | ca14 | 77 ===
I think i'll play the karate
dancer jean next. I don't
have the legs for it now...[BRK]

But i'm drinking milk, so
watch out![END]

=== 44 | ca98 | 49 ===
[POR10]
You better be drinking a
lot of milk, sweetie. Those
legs need work...[END]

=== 45 | caf4 | 4b ===
When we decide to play out
here, the last one in the
game has to be borgan.[END]

=== 46 | cb56 | 46 ===
I hate it when i get stuck
playing borgan. He's nothing
but a fat pig.[END]

=== 47 | cbb0 | 6d ===
Borgan, borgan, fatty man.
If he won't eat it, no one
can![BRK]

My brother taught me that
one. How do you like it?[END]

=== 48 | cc30 | a7 ===
....
.....[BRK]

You know, i'm starting to
get tired of running around
out here.[BRK]

Maybe it's time i grew up
and learned some respon-
sibility...[BRK]

Nah!
......hahahahahahahahha![END]

=== 49 | ccdc | 7 ===
Meribia[END]

[POR27]
Welcome to the legendary
ramus' store.[BRK]

I'm ramus, the current
owner of this store.[BRK]

[POR07]
Hi, ramus. How's your little
business going?[BRK]

[POR27]
Business really looks bleak!
This is the worst depression
i've seen in years![END]

=== 4b | f2e2 | 1a1 ===
[POR27]
I'm already starting to 
think that i should start 
filing chapter 11.[BRK]

[POR07]
Ramus! What kind of 
business teacher are you?[BRK]

If you can't even take care 
of this store, how are you
supposed to help me?[BRK]

[POR02]
Lemina's teacher!?[BRK]

[POR07]
He's not my magic teacher.
Everyone knows that ramus' 
family can't use magic.[BRK]

But they all have a keen
sense of how to make
money![BRK]

[POR02]
Yeah, it looks like he's 
done wonders with this 
place.[END]

=== 4c | f49e | d6 ===
[POR27]
I just can't think of any
moneymaking schemes lately.[BRK]

[POR07]
So it looks like you better
just pay up, then, little
man.[BRK]

'Cause i'll be able to 
restore the guild before you
turn a profit on this store.













[END]

=== 4d | f58c | 2a0 ===
[POR27]
We were cleaning up in this
place the other day and 
found an underground path.[BRK]

The entrance is over on the 
wall, and it goes deep 
within the meribian sewers.[BRK]

The original ramus left a
clause in his will warning
us never to go down there.[BRK]

He said he was almost killed 
by a vicious water dragon.[BRK]

That's when he had to end
his quest with dragonmaster 
alex.[BRK]

Many years later, he
admitted that he was so
scared he pooped his pants![BRK]

It was then that he realized
that he wasn't cut out for
adventuring.[BRK]

[POR07]
Ramus, are you stupid? There
could be hidden treasures
down there![BRK]

[POR27]
Money isn't worth risking
your life.[BRK]

Okay, well, yes it is, but
i'm not going to go down
there.[END]

=== 4e | f848 | 52 ===
[POR27]
I'm never going down there!
Just remember: if you find
any treasure, it's mine![END]

=== 4f | f8ae | 84 ===
[POR27]
I'm showing sneak previews
of my new 'tunnels of
carnage' attraction.[BRK]

We've converted the meribian
sewers...[BRK]

It's gonna be great![END]

=== 50 | f94a | 101 ===
[POR27]
Finding that underground 
passage was the best thing
to happen to this store![BRK]

I've turned it into a
magical haunted ride.[BRK]

I've gathered a ton of kids
who work for peanuts...[BRK]

And continuing on with the
family tradition, i've hired 
only beautiful women...[END]

=== 51 | fa58 | db ===
[POR07]
Ramus, you're a living
legend! You've turned this
place into a giant bank![BRK]

With all the money you're
going to get you shouldn't
have to go bankrupt![BRK]

Say, you don't want to make
a small donation to the 
guild, do you?[END]

=== 52 | fb4e | 4c ===
[POR27]
This haunted house idea was
the best thing to ever 
happen to this place![END]

=== 53 | fbb0 | b7 ===
[POR27]
Hiro and ronfar, you're more
than welcome to come in and
see the sights...[BRK]

[POR05]
Sure! I'd like to see just
how attractive these sights
can be![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

...wait for me![BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro!![END]

=== 54 | fc7a | 8b ===
[POR27]
Since i've started 
advertising this little 
place, business is booming![BRK]

People are coming from all
over just to take a ten
minute ride![END]

=== 55 | fd12 | 1aa ===
[POR27]
Lemina, i'd like to raise
the stakes in our little
bet.[BRK]

If you rebuild the magic
guild before i turn a 
profit...[BRK]

I'll donate all future 
profits to the magic guild![BRK]

[POR07]
Mega-cool! That's the kind 
of bet i would like to win!![BRK]

[POR27]
However, if i win, you will
have to become my wife![BRK]

After all, that's how all of
the ramus family got their
beautiful wives![BRK]

[POR07]
Yeah, you bought them!
I don't think i like this
proposal anymore.[END]

=== 56 | fed8 | 12c ===
[POR27]
Sorry, my little teddy bear,
you already agreed to my
terms.[BRK]

And after all, verbal 
agreements are binding in
meribia.[BRK]

But don't worry! I'll make
sure the guild gets rebuilt,
one way or another![BRK]

[POR07]
I can't believe i agreed
to that stupid bet![BRK]

I've gotta win or i'm going
to be wed to fatty cheeks.[END]

=== 57 | 10020 | 1f9 ===
[POR27]
It's not like i'm going to
win overnight lemina, but
i do want to marry you.[BRK]

It's like dad always said:
'the best brides are bought 
brides.'[BRK]

And i'm beginning to think
he was right![BRK]

[POR07]
....
.....[BRK]

Don't worry, anus, it's not
like i'm going to back out
of our little bet.[BRK]

[POR27]
Lemina! You are starting to
like me!! And you've 
already given me a pet name.[BRK]

Dad said if you give 'em
enough time, they'll grow
to love ya![BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! I don't love ya, and
i don't intend to lose! I'll
be back to get my money!!

[END]

=== 58 | 10234 | e3 ===
[POR27]
Hello, my darling angel. Is
everything going all right
with you??[BRK]

[POR07]
Hello, anus, don't start
gloating yet. You still 
haven't won![BRK]

[POR02]
I don't see you trying to
win the bet, lemina.[BRK]

Maybe you secretly long to
be ramus' wife.[END]

=== 59 | 1032a | ab ===
Hello <hick> my lovely 
little <hick> girl!![BRK]

Didja bring anything 
that'll <hick> please an
old man?[BRK]

[POR07]
He's nothing more than a
drunken gambler! Kind of
like you, ronfar.[END]

=== 5a | 103ec | 139 ===
I haven't <hick> seen you
in a long time, lemina.[BRK]

Did you sneak any wine from
the town of wine past ramus?[BRK]

[POR07]
That's vane, grandpa, and
no, i didn't bring you any
wine![BRK]

It's weird. Every tenth boy
in ramus' family is named
ramus.[BRK]

They're kinda stuck on the 
name, since the first ramus
knew dragonmaster alex.



[END]

=== 5b | 10538 | 97 ===
I think junior is going
to kick me out of this
place![BRK]

He's mad that i made that
big hole in the wall.[BRK]

I though it might lead to a
secret wine cellar...[END]

=== 5c | 105e6 | ea ===
Good job, junior! This 
business is really starting
to take off![BRK]

I think i'm going to go 
inspect some of the 
merchandise...[BRK]

[POR27]
Grandpa, last time you did
that, we were stuck with a
huge lawsuit![BRK]

That's why we almost lost
this store![END]

=== 5d | 106ec | 6b ===
That stupid grandson of mine
won't even let me inspect 
the employees...[BRK]

I really hate that kid 
sometimes.[END]

=== 5e | 1076a | 82 ===
I hope ramus makes this 
store as great as it was
originally.[BRK]

That's when we had all the
money, and i could do 
whatever i wanted![END]

=== 5f | 10804 | 105 ===
Hello, my new granddaughter!
Ramus told me you two were
going to get married.[BRK]

I can't wait for that kid to
have some children of his
own...[BRK]

[POR07]
Wait! Wait a minute!! 
I never agreed to this![BRK]

Ramus hasn't won yet,
grandpa.[BRK]

Who knows? I still might be
able to win.[END]

=== 60 | 10924 | 92 ===
I've decided that i'm going
to help ramus win that 
little bet of his...[BRK]

Welcome to the family, my
dear! You're going to make
ramus one happy man.[END]

=== 61 | 109d2 | 170 ===
I told ramus to shower you
with gifts, and to make sure
they were the finest.[BRK]

Everyone knows that a woman
will marry any man that
buys them stuff.[BRK]

[POR02]
...they've found your weak
spot, lemina! What are you
going to do with the gifts?[BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! Just because a man 
buys a woman something 
doesn't mean they'll wed.[BRK]

I'm just gonna take the
gifts and sell them for 
money!

[END]

=== 62 | 10b52 | 9a ===
When i was tending the store
last night, i heard crying

Good! I want him to earn

Pretty scary, huh?[BRK]

I've taken just about

It's a pretty nerve-wracking
job, but someone has to do
it.[END]

i've ever had.[END]

I've asked ramus to let me

Every day it's the same old

Take people into the sewer,

If it wasn't for all the 
money i'm making, i'd've
quit already.

[POR27]
Welcome to the legendary
ramus' store.[BRK]

I'm ramus, the current
owner of this store.[BRK]

[POR07]
Hi, ramus. How's your little
business going?[BRK]

[POR27]
Business really looks bleak!
This is the worst depression
i've seen in years![END]

=== 7f | 12770 | 1a1 ===
[POR27]
I'm already starting to 
think that i should start 
filing chapter 11.[BRK]

[POR07]
Ramus! What kind of 
business teacher are you?[BRK]

If you can't even take care 
of this store, how are you
supposed to help me?[BRK]

[POR02]
Lemina's teacher!?[BRK]

[POR07]
He's not my magic teacher.
Everyone knows that ramus' 
family can't use magic.[BRK]

But they all have a keen
sense of how to make
money![BRK]

[POR02]
Yeah, it looks like he's 
done wonders with this 
place.[END]

=== 80 | 1292c | d6 ===
[POR27]
I just can't think of any
moneymaking schemes lately.[BRK]

[POR07]
So it looks like you better
just pay up, then, little
man.[BRK]

'Cause i'll be able to 
restore the guild before you
turn a profit on this store.













[END]

=== 81 | 12a1a | 2a0 ===
[POR27]
We were cleaning up in this
place the other day and
found an underground path.[BRK]

The entrance is over on the
wall, and it goes deep
within the meribian sewers.[BRK]

The original ramus left a
clause in his will warning
us never to go down there.[BRK]

He said he was almost killed
by a vicious water dragon.[BRK]

That's when he had to end
his quest with dragonmaster
alex.[BRK]

Many years later, he
admitted that he was so
scared he pooped his pants![BRK]

It was then that he realized
that he wasn't cut out for
adventuring.[BRK]

[POR07]
Ramus, are you stupid? There
could be hidden treasures
down there![BRK]

[POR27]
Money isn't worth risking
your life...[BRK]

Okay, well, yes it is, but
i'm not going to go down
there.


[END]

=== 82 | 12cd6 | 52 ===
[POR27]
I'm never going down there!
Just remember: if you find
any treasure, it's mine![END]

I'm showing sneak previews
of my new 'tunnels of

We've converted the meribian
sewers...[BRK]

It's gonna be great![END]

=== 84 | 12dd8 | 101 ===
[POR27]
Finding that underground 
passage was the best thing
to happen to this store![BRK]

I've turned it into a
magical haunted ride.[BRK]

I've gathered a ton of kids
who work for peanuts...[BRK]

And continuing on with the
family tradition, i've hired 
only beautiful women...[END]

=== 85 | 12ee6 | db ===
[POR07]
Ramus, you're a living
legend! You've turned this
place into a giant bank![BRK]

With all the money you're
going to get, you shouldn't
have to go bankrupt![BRK]

Say, you don't want to make
a small donation to the
guild, do you?[END]

=== 86 | 12fdc | 4c ===
[POR27]
This haunted house idea was
the best thing to ever 
happen to this place![END]

[POR27]
Hiro and ronfar, you're more
than welcome to come in and
see the sights...[BRK]

[POR05]
Sure! I'd like to see just
how attractive these sights
can be![BRK]

over just to take a ten
minute ride![END]

=== 89 | 131a0 | 1aa ===
[POR27]
Lemina, i'd like to raise
the stakes in our little
bet.[BRK]

If you rebuild the magic
guild before i turn a 
profit...[BRK]

I'll donate all future 
profits to the magic guild![BRK]

[POR07]
Mega-cool! That's the kind 
of bet i would like to win!![BRK]

[POR27]
However, if i win, you will
have to become my wife![BRK]

After all, that's how all of
the ramus family got their
beautiful wives![BRK]

[POR07]
Yeah, you bought them!
I don't think i like this
proposal anymore.[END]

=== 8a | 13366 | 12c ===
[POR27]
Sorry, my little teddy bear,
you already agreed to my
terms.[BRK]

And after all, verbal 
agreements are binding in
meribia.[BRK]

But don't worry! I'll make
sure the guild gets rebuilt,
one way or another![BRK]

[POR07]
I can't believe i agreed
to that stupid bet![BRK]

I've gotta win or i'm going
to be wed to fatty cheeks.[END]

=== 8b | 134ae | 1f9 ===
[POR27]
It's not like i'm going to
win overnight, lemina, but
i do want to marry you.[BRK]

It's like dad always said:
'the best brides are bought 
brides.'[BRK]

And i'm beginning to think
he was right![BRK]

[POR07]
....
.....[BRK]

Don't worry, anus, it's not
like i'm going to back out
of our little bet.[BRK]

[POR27]
Lemina! You are starting to
like me!! And you've
already given me a pet name.[BRK]

Dad said if you give 'em
enough time, they'll grow
to love ya![BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! I don't love ya, and
i don't intend to lose! I'll
be back to get my money!!

[POR27]
Hello, my darling angel. Is
everything going all right
with you?[BRK]

[POR07]
Hello, anus. Don't start
gloating yet. You still 
haven't won![BRK]

[POR02]
I don't see you trying to
win the bet, lemina.[BRK]

Maybe you secretly long to
be ramus' wife.
[END]

=== 8d | 137b8 | ab ===
Hello <hick> my lovely
little <hick> girl!![BRK]

Did ya bring anything 
that'll <hick> please an
old man?[BRK]

[POR07]
He's nothing more than a
drunken gambler! Kind of
like you, ronfar.[END]

=== 8e | 1387a | 139 ===
I haven't <hick> seen you
in a long time, lemina.[BRK]

Did you sneak any wine from
the town of wine past ramus?[BRK]

[POR07]
That's vane, grandpa, and
no, i didn't bring you any
wine![BRK]

It's weird. Every tenth boy
in ramus' family is named
ramus.[BRK]

They're kinda stuck on the 
name, since the first ramus
knew dragonmaster alex.



[END]

=== 8f | 139c6 | 97 ===
I think junior is going
to kick me out of this
place![BRK]

He's mad that i made that
big hole in the wall.[BRK]

I though it might lead to a
secret wine cellar...[END]

Good job, junior! This
business is really starting
to take off![BRK]

I think i'm going to go
inspect some of the
merchandise...[BRK]

Grandpa, last time you did
that, we were stuck with a
huge lawsuit![BRK]

That's why we almost lost
this store!!

That stupid grandson of mine
won't even let me inspect 
the employees...[BRK]

I really hate that kid 
sometimes.[END]

I hope ramus makes this 
store as great as it was
originally.[BRK]

That's when we had all the
money, and i could do 
whatever i wanted![END]

=== 93 | 13c92 | 105 ===
Hello, my new granddaughter!
Ramus told me you two were
going to get married.[BRK]

I can't wait for that kid to
have some children of his
own...[BRK]

[POR07]
Wait! Wait a minute!! 
I never agreed to this![BRK]

Ramus hasn't won yet,
grandpa.[BRK]

Who knows? I still might be
able to win.[END]

=== 94 | 13db2 | 92 ===
I've decided that i'm going
to help ramus win that 
little bet of his...[BRK]

Welcome to the family, my
dear! You're going to make
ramus one happy man.[END]

=== 95 | 13e60 | 170 ===
I told ramus to shower you
with gifts, and to make sure
they were the finest.[BRK]

Everyone knows that a woman
will marry any man that
buys them stuff.[BRK]

[POR02]
They've found your weak
spot, lemina! What are you
going to do with the gifts?[BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! Just because a man 
buys a woman something 
doesn't mean they'll wed.[BRK]

I'm just going to take the
gifts and sell them for 
money!

Taben's peak? Well, it's to
the east of meribia...[BRK]

But if i were you, i'd stay

Lunn built this dojo to 
encourage people to study 
the martial arts.[BRK]

Some say he's the best 
teacher in the world.[END]

=== 10c | 1c648 | bb ===
Master lunn isn't in meribia
at the moment.[BRK]

He was summoned to the holy 
city pentagulia by the 
goddess.[BRK]

There must be trouble in the
world if she's requested 
lunn to come and help her.[END]

Master lunn is not in at 
this time. May i take a 
message for him?[END]

I'm sorry, but master lunn
still hasn't returned to
meribia.[BRK]

He's probably off saving the
world from evil.  Lunn is 
just a great guy![END]

=== 10f | 1c7fe | b9 ===
It seems that the bandits of
taben's peak have blocked 
the path leading to vane.[BRK]

But they're afraid of
master lunn.[BRK]

I think he's going to go 
there and put an end to 
their rebellion.
[END]

=== 110 | 1c8ca | 8b ===
Master lunn has made sure
that the peace in this 
district is maintained.[BRK]

He's even had to crack a few
skulls to get his peace plan
across![END]

I've heard the bandits of
taben's peak have enlisted
children to fight for them.[BRK]

What kind of sick person 
would cause children to 
fight in a war??[BRK]

[POR02]
Evidently, a really sick 
one![END]

=== 112 | 1ca2e | a6 ===
Some say lunn was born to 
fight...[BRK]

Others say it's because he
got tired of being beaten
up when he was a kid.[BRK]

I think lunn just likes to
beat the crap out of people![END]

=== 113 | 1caec | 86 ===
I'm training so that i can
go with lunn to taben's
peak.[BRK]

I just want to go with him
and watch him beat the 
snot out of those bandits.[END]

=== 114 | 1cb8a | 94 ===
I think it's going to be so
fun to watch lunn fight in
actual combat.[BRK]

I can just see him pounding 
on those bandits, beating
them into the ground...[END]

I don't know why lunn takes
such delight in beating up
us new guys...[END]

I think master lunn is way
too busy to train all of us.[BRK]

His business for the goddess
keeps him really busy...[END]

=== 117 | 1cd0e | 95 ===
Many people think that lunn
should be given the title
of 'holy karate master'...[BRK]

I don't know if lunn would
accept such a self-serving
title as that.[END]

=== 118 | 1cdb0 | 1f ===
[POR10]
Somehow, i think he
would...[END]

If master lunn doesn't want

Since master lunn isn't due
back for awhile, do you 
think you could train us?[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sorry, but i just don't
believe in teaching people
how to fight...[BRK]

I only fight because i have
to, not because i want to.[END]

=== 11e | 1d18c | bd ===
Sure you only fight because
you have to...[BRK]

That's why your skills are 
nearly perfected! I don't
think so.[BRK]

You don't want to teach me
because you're afraid that
i'll become better than you.[END]

Please don't disturb any of

back here to meribia.[END]

for assassination.[BRK]

[POR16]
Black karate of death?!
Assassination!?[BRK]

I've never heard anything 
like this before...[BRK]

[POR10]
I know. For the person who
created this karate remains
a mystery to me.[BRK]

He is a coward that hides
behind a mask so that no one
may learn his true identity.[BRK]

A long time ago i was
enslaved to his wicked
group, but i escaped...[BRK]

He calls his devilish sect
the blue dragon cult,[BRK]

but his teachings are far
removed from the light of
the blue dragon.[BRK]

He must be stopped.[BRK]

[POR16]
Jean, thank you for bringing
this matter to my attention.[BRK]

I cannot forgive anyone that
would train another in the
ways of such evil.[BRK]

I will find this masked man
and put an end to his reign
of terror![BRK]

It is rumored that the blue
dragon cult is located near
taben's peak...[BRK]

I believe that these may be
the same 'bandits' that are
attacking people there.[BRK]

Jean, i would like to make
a request of you...[BRK]

Go to taben's peak and
search for a link between
the bandits and this 'cult.'[BRK]

Once you find their hideout,
i will lead an attack on it.[BRK]

Know this: i will bring
them to justice.[BRK]

One way or another...[BRK]

[POR10]
I will do all that you have
requested of me! Thank you,
master lunn.
[END]

[POR16]
Jean, you do not dress like
someone who practices 
karate.[BRK]

[POR10]
After i escaped from the
blue dragon cult, i swore
never to use karate...[BRK]

I'm still torn as to the
path i should take, however.[BRK]

[POR16]
You must realize that karate
is not evil. Only the weak
use karate in evil ways.[BRK]

There is nothing wrong with
you using karate as long as
you use it correctly.[BRK]

Jean...come--train under
my watchful eye...[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[BRK]

Please, i need time to think
about your offer...[BRK]

But for now i'm going to go
to taben's peak to find this
masked terror!

[END]

=== 13a | 1f006 | eb ===
[POR16]
Have you finally decided if
you're going to accept my 
offer and train with me?[BRK]

[POR10]
Lunn, i still need time to 
think about it...[BRK]

I don't know if i want to
devote my life to fighting,[BRK]

when dance gives me the
power to be truly free...[END]

=== 13b | 1f100 | 65 ===
Lunn is well respected
by everyone in meribia.[BRK]

He has worked hard to make
this city a peaceful haven.[END]

=== 13c | 1f178 | ce ===
I've worked so closely with
master lunn during the last
few years...[BRK]

That i have devoted myself
to continue in his 
footsteps.[BRK]

I hope that master lunn will
pick me to join him in any
of his future missions.[END]

=== 13d | 1f25a | 5c ===
I'm still practicing my
karate...[BRK]

But master lunn said that I
need to exercise my brain
too.[END]

=== 13e | 1f2c6 | 85 ===
I've decided that the really
powerful people have great
minds.[BRK]

I've decided that i'm going
to train my mind before I
work on my body.[END]

=== 13f | 1f358 | 6c ===
[POR02]
From my vantage point, i 
think you should invest
some time in that body.[BRK]

Perhaps 'deal a meal'
can help?[END]

=== 140 | 1f3d8 | 84 ===
Some say that master lunn is
as strong as lord leo.[BRK]

I think that if they ever 
fought, we'd have one hell
of a pay-per-view special.[END]

=== 141 | 1f474 | 53 ===
I would like to be lunn's
fight promoter.[BRK]

I would become filthy rich
promoting him.[END]

=== 142 | 1f4e2 | 5f ===
I'm tired of promoting these
little guys.[BRK]

It's a waste of time and
there's no money to be
made.[END]

=== 143 | 1f550 | 7b ===
I tell ya, you only get
one chance at fame![BRK]

Too bad some try to stay
in the spotlight long after
their welcome is worn out.[END]

=== 144 | 1f5de | 8e ===
I can't believe that master
lunn is able to do all his
work for the goddess...[BRK]

...and still have time to
train us all in the ways of
karate.

[END]

=== 145 | 1f684 | 34 ===
I'm trying to be a great
master of karate like lunn.[END]

=== 146 | 1f6d0 | 51 ===
You should've seen me last
night! I really kicked the
stuffing out of this guy...[END]

=== 147 | 1f73c | 50 ===
The tournament in horam is
coming up in the next few
weeks. I've gotta practice.[END]

=== 148 | 1f79c | 95 ===
I really want to go to 
lunch, but the new guy won't
be here for another hour...[BRK]

I'm going to talk to my boss
and see if i can work the 
night shift.[END]

=== 149 | 1f844 | 91 ===
I really hate studying about
the four heroes in school...[BRK]

History-schmistery...it's
all just boring crap about
old farts![BRK]

Who needs to know that?[END]

=== 14a | 1f8ec | 7e ===
We just started learning 
about dragonmaster alex and
his companions...[BRK]

I'm starting to warm up to
this whole history thing...[END]

=== 14b | 1f982 | cc ===
I learned that dragonmaster
alex was just a kid like me,[BRK]

but he was chosen by the
white dragon to become the
next dragonmaster...[BRK]

...and save our world from
evil. Whooo...dragonmasters
seem soooo cool..

[END]

=== 14c | 1fa5c | 3a ===
[POR10]
I wonder what ever became 
of the last dragonmaster...?[END]

=== 14d | 1fab2 | 43 ===
Some say that there's a
new dragonmaster that
protects the goddess.[END]

=== 14e | 1fb08 | ce ===
History is really starting
to become boring again...[BRK]

We've started learning about
the stupid blue star and how
our ancestors came here...[BRK]

I'd rather be studying about
the four dragons and the
dragonmasters.[END]

=== 14f | 1fbe6 | 69 ===
Master lunn said i should
study harder in school...[BRK]

He's starting to sound just
like my stupid parents...[END]

=== 150 | 1fc5e | 84 ===
Master lunn is in his 
private chambers right now.[BRK]

He is listening to all of 
our problems. If you've got
a problem, go talk to him.[END]

=== 151 | 1fcfa | d1 ===
Master lunn's karate draws
on the teachings of several
different styles.[BRK]

He's trying to develop the
most powerful karate ever
known to man.[BRK]

Don't let his quest for 
power fool ya. He's really 
got a big heart.[END]

=== 152 | 1fde6 | 7c ===
Last time i checked, lunn
was in there, but then
again,[BRK]

he has been known to sneak
outta here quietly, if ya
get my drift...[END]

=== 153 | 1fe72 | 74 ===
Lunn has taken over the 
town of horam.[BRK]

That's the town where only
the most dedicated students
go to study karate...[END]

=== 154 | 1fefe | a5 ===
Lunn won't be back for a
long time.[BRK]

The goddess althena made a
request that he go to 
pentagulia...[BRK]

I'm sure he won't be back
until he's solved that 
little problem.[END]

=== 155 | 1ffbe | 8b ===
If something is troubling
you, my child, you can
discuss it with me.[BRK]

Don't worry. As a priest,
i cannot tell anyone what
you've told me.


[END]

The goddess althena taught
us that humans have true
power...[BRK]
