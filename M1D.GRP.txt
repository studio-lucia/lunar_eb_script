This is Meribia. Lunn has a
dojo set up here devoted to
Blue Dragon Karate.[BRK]

I need to check it out.[END]

=== 1 | a202 | 6f ===
Welcome to Meribia![BRK]

The most popular sites in
town are Ramus' store and
Lunn's dojo.[BRK]

Be sure to check them out![END]

=== 2 | a280 | ba ===
Did you come to Meribia to
see Ramus' wondrous store?[BRK]

Rumor has it that it's been
in his family for over 900
years![BRK]

You know, it's become so
famous, other merchants are
coming to see it![END]

=== 3 | a34c | 4a ===
[POR07]
Hmmm...Maybe he can give me
a few marketing tips for the
Magic Guild...[END]

=== 4 | a3a8 | 81 ===
[POR02]
Hey there, Lemina, it looks
like you're gonna lose your
bet with Ramus![BRK]

You ready to be his blushing
bride?[BRK]

[POR07]
We'll see...[END]

=== 5 | a43c | 6e ===
I heard that there are vast
sewers that run under this
city.[BRK]

If you find out where they
are, will you tell me?[END]

=== 6 | a4c2 | aa ===
Why are you talking to me
again? I don't need your
help anymore...[BRK]

I just remembered where the
entrance to the Meribian
sewers was.[BRK]

So just get lost. You're
annoying me.[END]

=== 7 | a580 | bb ===
I was told to look for the
entrance to the sewers of
this city.[BRK]

I've got to find them for
my boss back on Taben's
Peak.[BRK]

If you saw him, you'd know
why I've got to do it. He's
a dreamboat![END]

=== 8 | a652 | 4a ===
Boo hoo hooo! Ooohhh, where
can that sewer entrance be?
...Booo hoo hoo![END]

=== 9 | a6ac | 9d ===
With all these people
around, you'd think someone
would know about the sewers![BRK]

I'm getting tired of bugging
everyone I see and getting
the same lame answer!![END]

=== a | a758 | 91 ===
Step right up! Step right on
in! Check out the wonders in
Ramus' wonder shop![BRK]

We have unusual items from
the known world! Some are
one-of-a-kind![END]

=== b | a7fc | d4 ===
Come one! Come all! Try out
Ramus' latest wonder, the
Tunnels of Carnage![BRK]

This action-packed thrill
ride will put you face-to-
face with death itself![BRK]

Only you decide the final
outcome. All the monsters
are real![END]

=== c | a8e4 | 6b ===
Will you try your luck with
the Tunnels of Carnage?[BRK]

I guarantee you'll not find
another attraction like it![END]

=== d | a95e | e6 ===
Looking for a thrill? Be
sure to check out Ramus' new
ga-ga go-go girls![BRK]

Fresh from their hot world
tour, now performing three
shows nightly![BRK]

[POR02]
Have we stepped into some
sort of Twilight Zone
episode?[BRK]

This town is just too
weird![END]

=== e | aa58 | 87 ===
The bandits seen around here
have a hideout on Taben's
Peak.[BRK]

If you're having trouble
with them, you might want to
talk to Master Lunn.[END]

=== f | aaf6 | 4c ===
Master Lunn is very powerful
in this city. If you have a
problem, go to him.[END]

=== 10 | ab56 | 89 ===
Did you finally meet Master
Lunn? Weren't you totally
impressed with him?[BRK]

I mean...Goddess Althena
trusts him most among the
Four Heroes.[END]

=== 11 | abec | 32 ===
[POR10]
Lunn certainly seems
to be one to be admired...[END]

=== 12 | ac32 | 79 ===
Master Lunn left for Penta-
gulia a while ago and hasn't
yet returned.[BRK]

Maybe he stopped by the
training grounds at Horam.[END]

=== 13 | acba | 11f ===
Say, did you hear the story
of the hero that saved the
world? Isn't it wonderful?[BRK]

I heard that a gambler, a
dancer, a magician, and a
dragon helped.[BRK]

I wish I could meet them.[BRK]

[POR02]
Hehe, uh...Funny how these
rumors get started, isn't
it?[BRK]

I actually heard that the
dragon helped the most...[END]

=== 14 | ade8 | cc ===
In other villages I've heard
Althena's Cult talking about
a dark god of destruction.[BRK]

I wonder why we never hear
about that here in Meribia.[BRK]

Oh well, it doesn't really
matter. Master Lunn looks
out for us.[END]

=== 15 | aec8 | 71 ===
Monster attacks have grown
to terrible proportions
lately.[BRK]

I'm so glad that Master Lunn
can protect us from them.[END]

=== 16 | af48 | b9 ===
You know, there really was
a dark god of destruction![BRK]

His name was Zophar. I say
'was' because someone
defeated him.[BRK]

I wonder if Master Lunn had
something to do with it? I
bet he did...[END]

=== 17 | b010 | 87 ===
Master Lunn has a dojo here
in Meribia where he teaches
Blue Dragon Karate.[BRK]

If you want to see him, go
now. I think he's still
there...[END]

=== 18 | b0aa | 6b ===
Master Lunn isn't at his
dojo right now.[BRK]

He left to visit Pentagulia.
Well, at least that's what
I heard...[END]

=== 19 | b124 | 90 ===
Master Lunn's dojo has been
very busy lately.[BRK]

Once word got out that a
student of his saved the
world,[BRK]

applications to his dojo
increased 2000%![END]

=== 1a | b1c6 | c0 ===
[POR07]
Jean! Did you hear that?
This is a mega-opportunity![BRK]

If we start a dojo and you
endorse it, we stand to make
a fortune![BRK]

[POR10]
Lemina, Lemina, Lemina...
I want to go back to
dancing, remember? [END]

=== 1b | b296 | de ===
Ah, welcome! You stand
before Master Lunn's world
famous dojo.[BRK]

He's a very busy person, but
you're in luck! Today he's
in the dojo training.[BRK]

If you want to talk to him
before he leaves for Penta-
gulia, you'd better hurry.[END]

=== 1c | b388 | 73 ===
Oh, I am sorry! Master Lunn
isn't here right now.[BRK]

He was called away to
Pentagulia unexpectedly
by Goddess Althena.[END]

=== 1d | b40a | cb ===
I heard that a student of
Master Lunn's defeated
Zophar after a big battle.[BRK]

I think that Master Lunn
would have had an easier
time, but hey, [BRK]

I guess we shouldn't
complain, eh? After all,
it was a chick![END]

=== 1e | b4e2 | 8a ===
[POR02]
Hey! That's not a very nice
thing to say! Don't you know
that...??[BRK]

[POR10]
It's okay, Ruby. It doesn't
bother me. This guy is an
imbecile...[END]

=== 1f | b57c | 95 ===
Master Lunn welcomes all who
desire to expand their minds
with new knowledge.[BRK]

If you want to learn the
secrets of Blue Dragon
Karate, visit his dojo.[END]

=== 20 | b628 | 7c ===
Master Lunn suddenly left
for Pentagulia at the
request of Althena herself![BRK]

Of the Four Heroes, I think
he is the busiest...[END]

=== 21 | b6c0 | 50 ===
Sorry, Master Lunn isn't
here.[BRK]

He's assisting the Goddess
Althena in Pentagulia.[END]

=== 22 | b720 | 6f ===
Boy, I certainly hope Master
Lunn returns soon.[BRK]

He's been gone so long, I'm
starting to get a little
worried...[END]

=== 23 | b79e | 73 ===
I came here from my home in
Nota to peddle my wares,[BRK]

but now bandits are blocking
the road to Vane! What will
I do?[END]

=== 24 | b824 | 7b ===
What? The bandits of Taben's
Peak have disappeared?[BRK]

Do you know what that means?
Now we can get to Vane! This
is fantastic![END]

=== 25 | b8b2 | 89 ===
Haven't you heard? The way
is open and the bandits are
gone![BRK]

Don't bother me now! I've
got to make preparations to
move my wares to Vane![END]

=== 26 | b948 | 43 ===
[POR07]
Well, get a move on! And I
hope you offer a magician's
discount![END]

=== 27 | b99e | aa ===
Oh dear, did you hear the
latest rumor?[BRK]

They say there are children
amongst the bandits![BRK]

These days, kids are just
running wild! What they need
is a good spanking, I say![END]

=== 28 | ba60 | d4 ===
You know, the more I hear
about these bandits from
Taben's Peak,[BRK]

the more paranoid I get!
Say, you're not one of them,
are you?[BRK]

[POR02]
Excuse me? When's the last
time you saw a red flying
bandit? I don't think so...[END]

=== 29 | bb4c | 81 ===
It seems awfully quiet
around here lately. Have all
the bandits gone away?[BRK]

...Or were there ever any 
real bandits to begin with?[END]

=== 2a | bbe8 | 69 ===
Now that the bandits have
disappeared, the rumor mill
has really quieted down.[BRK]

I sorta miss the action...[END]

=== 2b | bc60 | 91 ===
Ever since Zophar was
defeated, this place has
been partyville.[BRK]

You know, if I didn't know
better, I'd think this month
was some sort of holiday![END]

=== 2c | bd04 | dc ===
I once heard that Ramus'
store used to have an outlet
in every town.[BRK]

But the current owner's dad
hit hard times and had to 
close all but this store.[BRK]

If things don't turn around
soon, he may have to close
this one, too.[END]

=== 2d | bdf8 | 62 ===
I heard that the last
Dragonmaster used to love
shopping at Ramus'.[BRK]

Seems kinda weird, doesn't
it?[END]

=== 2e | be6e | f5 ===
Whoo hoo! I just tried out
the Tunnels of Carnage![BRK]

That has got to be the best
ride Ramus ever made![BRK]

Look at this![BRK]

See?!...See?! That's real
blood!...My blood![BRK]

I barely escaped with my
life!...What a total
rush! Ha ha ha ha ha![BRK]

Whooo hoooooo![END]

=== 2f | bf72 | 93 ===
I think Tunnels of Carnage
has been such a success that
Ramus can expand again.[BRK]

Maybe he can build it back
into a worldwide chain like
it once was.[END]

=== 30 | c018 | dd ===
Master Lunn teaches us not
only the ways of Blue Dragon
Karate, but good health.[BRK]

Even though I'm quite old,
I'm still in fantastic
shape.[BRK]

See...feel my butt! Hard as
a rock and soft as a baby's!
You can't buy that, kiddo![END]

=== 31 | c10c | 67 ===
Lunn taught me discipline.
Thanks to him, I have buns
of iron.[BRK]

I can bend steel bars with
these babies![END]

=== 32 | c182 | a3 ===
I wish Lunn would come back
soon! I need his guidance to
stick with my program.[BRK]

I think I've started
slipping.[BRK]

Yesterday, I lusted for a
Ding-Dong.[BRK]

I'm so ashamed.[END]

=== 33 | c238 | 7a ===
Say there, you guys fought
any big monsters?[BRK]

You did!!? Say, how'd you
escape? You look too wimpy
to beat 'em in a fight..[END]

=== 34 | c2ca | 79 ===
My dad just bought me a G.I.
Lunn with the kung-fu grip![BRK]

I'm so excited! Now I can
practice being one of the
Four Heroes![END]

=== 35 | c352 | 67 ===
Master Lunn said he was
going to Horam to make his
karate stronger.[BRK]

Man, I wish I was as cool
as him...[END]

=== 36 | c3cc | 63 ===
Haiiii...yaaaaaaa![BRK]

How did that look? I'm
practicing my form so Master
Lunn will agree to train me![END]

=== 37 | c446 | 2d ===
Oooouuhhhhhh! Wahhhhh! Ha!
Haiiiiiii...yaaaa![END]

=== 38 | c486 | 9b ===
I'm tired of playing Master
of the Four Heroes. Wanna
make a new game?[BRK]

My friend told me about one
called 'Doctor' that sounds
fun. Do ya know how to play?[END]

=== 39 | c538 | 83 ===
Hey! I know what game we can
play! Let's play 'World
Warriors!'[BRK]

We need five people. I'll
play the drunken priest.[BRK]

Who will you be?[END]

=== 3a | c5c8 | 41 ===
[POR05]
Hey squirt, you're really
pushing your luck today,
aren't you?[END]

=== 3b | c61c | 81 ===
Haaa! I am White Knight Leo!
Halt in the name of Goddess
Althena![BRK]

If you do not, I will have
to flail your rank bottom,
stranger![END]

=== 3c | c6b4 | a2 ===
Halt!
     Halt!
          Halt![BRK]

...Ahhhhhh! Come back here,
cretin! I have a warrant for
your arrest![BRK]

Don't you know who I am?
I am White Knight Leo,
greatest...[END]

=== 3d | c76a | 4a ===
I want a new game to play!
We've already played White
Knight Leo to death![END]

=== 3e | c7c8 | bd ===
If you don't have any new
ideas for games to play, I
guess I'll play Leo again![BRK]

......Ha! Halt there,
stranger, or I'll crush you
with my kung-fu grip![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Leo is so completely cool![END]

=== 3f | c892 | 1b ===
[POR09]
....
Uh, right, kid...[END]

=== 40 | c8c0 | 4e ===
Cower before me dung eaters!
I'm Red Priest Mauri, most
powerful in the land![END]

=== 41 | c926 | 78 ===
Hahahahahahaa...[BRK]

Whooooooooo!
Ahhhhhhhhhh![BRK]

I said cower before me!
Are you deaf and stupid?![BRK]

Don't you know who I am?!![END]

=== 42 | c9b2 | 4e ===
I like playing Mauri. She's
so powerful I can imagine
doing almost anything...[END]

=== 43 | ca14 | 77 ===
I think I'll play the karate
dancer Jean next. I don't
have the legs for it now...[BRK]

But I'm drinking milk, so
watch out![END]

=== 44 | ca98 | 49 ===
[POR10]
You better be drinking a
lot of milk, sweetie. Those
legs need work...[END]

=== 45 | caf4 | 4b ===
When we decide to play out
here, the last one in the
game has to be Borgan.[END]

=== 46 | cb56 | 46 ===
I hate it when I get stuck
playing Borgan. He's nothing
but a fat pig.[END]

=== 47 | cbb0 | 6d ===
Borgan, Borgan, fatty man.
If he won't eat it, no one
can![BRK]

My brother taught me that
one. How do you like it?[END]

=== 48 | cc30 | a7 ===
....
.....[BRK]

You know, I'm starting to
get tired of running around
out here.[BRK]

Maybe it's time I grew up
and learned some respon-
sibility...[BRK]

Nah!
......Hahahahahahahahha![END]

=== 49 | ccdc | 7 ===
Meribia[END]

=== 4a | f1f0 | d6 ===
[POR27]
Welcome to the legendary
Ramus' store.[BRK]

I'm Ramus, the current
owner of this store.[BRK]

[POR07]
Hi, Ramus. How's your little
business going?[BRK]

[POR27]
Business really looks bleak!
This is the worst depression
I've seen in years![END]

=== 4b | f2e2 | 1a1 ===
[POR27]
I'm already starting to 
think that I should start 
filing chapter 11.[BRK]

[POR07]
Ramus! What kind of 
business teacher are you?[BRK]

If you can't even take care 
of this store, how are you
supposed to help me?[BRK]

[POR02]
Lemina's teacher!?[BRK]

[POR07]
He's not my magic teacher.
Everyone knows that Ramus' 
family can't use magic.[BRK]

But they all have a keen
sense of how to make
money![BRK]

[POR02]
Yeah, it looks like he's 
done wonders with this 
place.[END]

=== 4c | f49e | d6 ===
[POR27]
I just can't think of any
moneymaking schemes lately.[BRK]

[POR07]
So it looks like you better
just pay up, then, little
man.[BRK]

'Cause I'll be able to 
restore the Guild before you
turn a profit on this store.[END]

=== 4d | f58c | 2a0 ===
[POR27]
We were cleaning up in this
place the other day and 
found an underground path.[BRK]

The entrance is over on the 
wall, and it goes deep 
within the Meribian sewers.[BRK]

The original Ramus left a
clause in his will warning
us never to go down there.[BRK]

He said he was almost killed 
by a vicious water dragon.[BRK]

That's when he had to end
his quest with Dragonmaster 
Alex.[BRK]

Many years later, he
admitted that he was so
scared he pooped his pants![BRK]

It was then that he realized
that he wasn't cut out for
adventuring.[BRK]

[POR07]
Ramus, are you stupid? There
could be hidden treasures
down there![BRK]

[POR27]
Money isn't worth risking
your life.[BRK]

Okay, well, yes it is, but
I'm not going to go down
there.[END]

=== 4e | f848 | 52 ===
[POR27]
I'm never going down there!
Just remember: if you find
any treasure, it's mine![END]

=== 4f | f8ae | 84 ===
[POR27]
I'm showing sneak previews
of my new 'Tunnels of
Carnage' attraction.[BRK]

We've converted the Meribian
sewers...[BRK]

It's gonna be great![END]

=== 50 | f94a | 101 ===
[POR27]
Finding that underground 
passage was the best thing
to happen to this store![BRK]

I've turned it into a
magical haunted ride.[BRK]

I've gathered a ton of kids
who work for peanuts...[BRK]

And continuing on with the
family tradition, I've hired 
only beautiful women...[END]

=== 51 | fa58 | db ===
[POR07]
Ramus, you're a living
legend! You've turned this
place into a giant bank![BRK]

With all the money you're
going to get you shouldn't
have to go bankrupt![BRK]

Say, you don't want to make
a small donation to the 
Guild, do you?[END]

=== 52 | fb4e | 4c ===
[POR27]
This haunted house idea was
the best thing to ever 
happen to this place![END]

=== 53 | fbb0 | b7 ===
[POR27]
Hiro and Ronfar, you're more
than welcome to come in and
see the sights...[BRK]

[POR05]
Sure! I'd like to see just
how attractive these sights
can be![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

...Wait for me![BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro!![END]

=== 54 | fc7a | 8b ===
[POR27]
Since I've started 
advertising this little 
place, business is booming![BRK]

People are coming from all
over just to take a ten
minute ride![END]

=== 55 | fd12 | 1aa ===
[POR27]
Lemina, I'd like to raise
the stakes in our little
bet.[BRK]

If you rebuild the Magic
Guild before I turn a 
profit...[BRK]

I'll donate all future 
profits to the Magic Guild![BRK]

[POR07]
Mega-cool! That's the kind 
of bet I would like to win!![BRK]

[POR27]
However, if I win, you will
have to become my wife![BRK]

After all, that's how all of
the Ramus family got their
beautiful wives![BRK]

[POR07]
Yeah, you bought them!
I don't think I like this
proposal anymore.[END]

=== 56 | fed8 | 12c ===
[POR27]
Sorry, my little teddy bear,
you already agreed to my
terms.[BRK]

And after all, verbal 
agreements are binding in
Meribia.[BRK]

But don't worry! I'll make
sure the Guild gets rebuilt,
one way or another![BRK]

[POR07]
I can't believe I agreed
to that stupid bet![BRK]

I've gotta win or I'm going
to be wed to fatty cheeks.[END]

=== 57 | 10020 | 1f9 ===
[POR27]
It's not like I'm going to
win overnight Lemina, but
I do want to marry you.[BRK]

It's like dad always said:
'The best brides are bought 
brides.'[BRK]

And I'm beginning to think
he was right![BRK]

[POR07]
....
.....[BRK]

Don't worry, anus, it's not
like I'm going to back out
of our little bet.[BRK]

[POR27]
Lemina! You are starting to
like me!! And you've 
already given me a pet name.[BRK]

Dad said if you give 'em
enough time, they'll grow
to love ya![BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! I don't love ya, and
I don't intend to lose! I'll
be back to get my money!![END]

=== 58 | 10234 | e3 ===
[POR27]
Hello, my darling angel. Is
everything going all right
with you??[BRK]

[POR07]
Hello, anus, don't start
gloating yet. You still 
haven't won![BRK]

[POR02]
I don't see you trying to
win the bet, Lemina.[BRK]

Maybe you secretly long to
be Ramus' wife.[END]

=== 59 | 1032a | ab ===
Hello <hick> my lovely 
little <hick> girl!![BRK]

Didja bring anything 
that'll <hick> please an
old man?[BRK]

[POR07]
He's nothing more than a
drunken gambler! Kind of
like you, Ronfar.[END]

=== 5a | 103ec | 139 ===
I haven't <hick> seen you
in a long time, Lemina.[BRK]

Did you sneak any wine from
the town of Wine past Ramus?[BRK]

[POR07]
That's Vane, Grandpa, and
no, I didn't bring you any
wine![BRK]

It's weird. Every tenth boy
in Ramus' family is named
Ramus.[BRK]

They're kinda stuck on the 
name, since the first Ramus
knew Dragonmaster Alex.[END]

=== 5b | 10538 | 97 ===
I think Junior is going
to kick me out of this
place![BRK]

He's mad that I made that
big hole in the wall.[BRK]

I though it might lead to a
secret wine cellar...[END]

=== 5c | 105e6 | ea ===
Good job, Junior! This 
business is really starting
to take off![BRK]

I think I'm going to go 
inspect some of the 
merchandise...[BRK]

[POR27]
Grandpa, last time you did
that, we were stuck with a
huge lawsuit![BRK]

That's why we almost lost
this store![END]

=== 5d | 106ec | 6b ===
That stupid grandson of mine
won't even let me inspect 
the employees...[BRK]

I really hate that kid 
sometimes.[END]

=== 5e | 1076a | 82 ===
I hope Ramus makes this 
store as great as it was
originally.[BRK]

That's when we had all the
money, and I could do 
whatever I wanted![END]

=== 5f | 10804 | 105 ===
Hello, my new granddaughter!
Ramus told me you two were
going to get married.[BRK]

I can't wait for that kid to
have some children of his
own...[BRK]

[POR07]
Wait! Wait a minute!! 
I never agreed to this![BRK]

Ramus hasn't won yet,
Grandpa.[BRK]

Who knows? I still might be
able to win.[END]

=== 60 | 10924 | 92 ===
I've decided that I'm going
to help Ramus win that 
little bet of his...[BRK]

Welcome to the family, my
dear! You're going to make
Ramus one happy man.[END]

=== 61 | 109d2 | 170 ===
I told Ramus to shower you
with gifts, and to make sure
they were the finest.[BRK]

Everyone knows that a woman
will marry any man that
buys them stuff.[BRK]

[POR02]
...They've found your weak
spot, Lemina! What are you
going to do with the gifts?[BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! Just because a man 
buys a woman something 
doesn't mean they'll wed.[BRK]

I'm just gonna take the
gifts and sell them for 
money![END]

=== 62 | 10b52 | 9a ===
When I was tending the store
last night, I heard crying
coming from behind the wall.[BRK]

I'm so scared, I can't even

at night.[END]

=== 63 | 10c00 | 9c ===
This place is really 
starting to give me the
creeps.[BRK]

Just look! The wall fell
down over there![BRK]

What's next? Man, I sure
hope it doesn't start oozing
blood![END]

=== 64 | 10cb0 | 6d ===
There's no way in hell that
I'll ever go down in that
creepfest of a hole![BRK]

Yes, I'm a coward and proud
of it![END]

=== 65 | 10d2c | a0 ===
Ramus is such a genius! He's
taken this store and turned
it into a Silver mine.[BRK]

I've received three raises
in the last week![BRK]

I'm finally going to be a
rich man![END]

=== 66 | 10de0 | ad ===
All of my family have worked
for the Ramus family for
years.[BRK]

This store is full of 
tradition and history...[BRK]

It is rumored that Goddess
Althena and Alex used to
come here...[END]

=== 67 | 10ea4 | 4c ===
I think that I might be 
looking for a new job if
business doesn't take off.[END]

=== 68 | 10f04 | 5f ===
This is really great! Our
business has tripled during
the last week.[BRK]

Nothing like job security![END]

=== 69 | 10f72 | 79 ===
Whoa! Lemina, I hear that 
you and the boss are going
to the Chapel of Love.[BRK]

I hope Ramus will ask me
to be his best man.[END]

Don't count on it, buster!
I'll never marry him![END]

My wife is thinking about
getting a divorce from me...[BRK]

She says I spend too much 
time in here looking at all
the pretty ladies.[END]

=== 6c | 110d0 | cf ===
I just love walking around
this store dropping things 
on the floor...[BRK]

Then all you have to do is
wait for one of those ladies
to come and pick it up![BRK]

I'm telling you, this place
has answered all my prayers![END]

=== 6d | 111b6 | 9b ===
Hi, Lemina. Did you come to
see Ramus?[BRK]

He's been working day and
night to try to make this
place a success.[BRK]

[POR07]
Good! I want him to earn
every Silver coin.[END]

=== 6e | 1126c | 3e ===
Ramus told me he's going
to make sure he weds you,
Lemina.[END]

=== 6f | 112be | 30 ===
I hear wedding bells. Don't
you, Lemina?[END]

=== 70 | 112fe | ca ===
So tell me: Once you marry
Ramus, will you come to work
for us?[BRK]

I hope so! I'd like to see
you run around in some of 
these garments.[BRK]

I know you'll look so hot
in them!! Ramus is one lucky
man...[END]

=== 71 | 113e4 | 99 ===
Watch it! Behind you!![BRK]

Pretty scary, huh?[BRK]

I've taken just about 
everyone through the sewers.[BRK]

It's a pretty nerve-wracking
job, but someone has to do
it.[END]

=== 72 | 1149c | 62 ===
I just love scaring the crap
out of people![BRK]

Yesterday, I had some guy
pee his pants![BRK]

What a loser![END]

=== 73 | 1151e | 89 ===
This is such a great job 
that I can't believe I
actually get paid for it![BRK]

I get to scare people and
watch them make fools of
themselves.[END]

=== 74 | 115ba | a7 ===
Ramus said that he's going
to open an 'after hours
haunted house...'[BRK]

He said it's going to be 
for adults only.[BRK]

I told him that I was 21 so
he'd let me give the tours.[END]

We've had the top make-up

Look out behind you!![BRK]

Sorry, I was just practicing
for when I have to take
people down into the sewers.[BRK]

I'm a tour guide, creep
master, whatever you want
to call me...[BRK]

This place is going to make
me rich...[END]

=== 78 | 11804 | be ===
Yesterday, I took a bunch of
people down into the sewers,
and told them that...[BRK]

If they each didn't give me
100s I was going to leave 
them there.[BRK]

This is one of the best jobs
I've ever had.[END]

=== 79 | 118e2 | 7b ===
I've been making a ton of 
money taking people into
the sewers...[BRK]

I've asked Ramus to let me
work a double shift 
everyday.[END]

=== 7a | 11970 | b7 ===
Every day it's the same old
scenario...[BRK]

Take people into the sewer,
act lost, steal their money 
and bring 'em out.[BRK]

If it wasn't for all the 
money I'm making, I'd've
quit already.[END]

=== 7b | 11a3e | 76 ===
Hey, pal, want me to take
you on a guided tour of the
sewers?[BRK]

Make sure you bring enough
Silver to get back out![END]

Meribia Ramus' Store[END]

=== 7e | 1267e | d6 ===
[POR27]
Welcome to the legendary
Ramus' store.[BRK]

I'm Ramus, the current
owner of this store.[BRK]

[POR07]
Hi, Ramus. How's your little
business going?[BRK]

[POR27]
Business really looks bleak!
This is the worst depression
I've seen in years![END]

=== 7f | 12770 | 1a1 ===
[POR27]
I'm already starting to 
think that I should start 
filing chapter 11.[BRK]

[POR07]
Ramus! What kind of 
business teacher are you?[BRK]

If you can't even take care 
of this store, how are you
supposed to help me?[BRK]

[POR02]
Lemina's teacher!?[BRK]

[POR07]
He's not my magic teacher.
Everyone knows that Ramus' 
family can't use magic.[BRK]

But they all have a keen
sense of how to make
money![BRK]

[POR02]
Yeah, it looks like he's 
done wonders with this 
place.[END]

=== 80 | 1292c | d6 ===
[POR27]
I just can't think of any
moneymaking schemes lately.[BRK]

[POR07]
So it looks like you better
just pay up, then, little
man.[BRK]

'Cause I'll be able to 
restore the Guild before you
turn a profit on this store.[END]

=== 81 | 12a1a | 2a0 ===
[POR27]
We were cleaning up in this
place the other day and
found an underground path.[BRK]

The entrance is over on the
wall, and it goes deep
within the Meribian sewers.[BRK]

The original Ramus left a
clause in his will warning
us never to go down there.[BRK]

He said he was almost killed
by a vicious water dragon.[BRK]

That's when he had to end
his quest with Dragonmaster
Alex.[BRK]

Many years later, he
admitted that he was so
scared he pooped his pants![BRK]

It was then that he realized
that he wasn't cut out for
adventuring.[BRK]

[POR07]
Ramus, are you stupid? There
could be hidden treasures
down there![BRK]

[POR27]
Money isn't worth risking
your life...[BRK]

Okay, well, yes it is, but
I'm not going to go down
there.[END]

=== 82 | 12cd6 | 52 ===
[POR27]
I'm never going down there!
Just remember: if you find
any treasure, it's mine![END]

=== 83 | 12d3c | 84 ===
[POR27]
I'm showing sneak previews
of my new 'Tunnels of
Carnage' attraction.[BRK]

We've converted the Meribian
sewers...[BRK]

It's gonna be great![END]

=== 84 | 12dd8 | 101 ===
[POR27]
Finding that underground 
passage was the best thing
to happen to this store![BRK]

I've turned it into a
magical haunted ride.[BRK]

I've gathered a ton of kids
who work for peanuts...[BRK]

And continuing on with the
family tradition, I've hired 
only beautiful women...[END]

=== 85 | 12ee6 | db ===
[POR07]
Ramus, you're a living
legend! You've turned this
place into a giant bank![BRK]

With all the money you're
going to get, you shouldn't
have to go bankrupt![BRK]

Say, you don't want to make
a small donation to the
Guild, do you?[END]

=== 86 | 12fdc | 4c ===
[POR27]
This haunted house idea was
the best thing to ever 
happen to this place![END]

=== 87 | 1303e | b7 ===
[POR27]
Hiro and Ronfar, you're more
than welcome to come in and
see the sights...[BRK]

[POR05]
Sure! I'd like to see just
how attractive these sights
can be![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

...Wait for me![BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro!![END]

=== 88 | 13108 | 8b ===
[POR27]
Since I've started 
advertising this little 
place, business is booming![BRK]

People are coming from all
over just to take a ten
minute ride![END]

=== 89 | 131a0 | 1aa ===
[POR27]
Lemina, I'd like to raise
the stakes in our little
bet.[BRK]

If you rebuild the Magic
Guild before I turn a 
profit...[BRK]

I'll donate all future 
profits to the Magic Guild![BRK]

[POR07]
Mega-cool! That's the kind 
of bet I would like to win!![BRK]

[POR27]
However, if I win, you will
have to become my wife![BRK]

After all, that's how all of
the Ramus family got their
beautiful wives![BRK]

[POR07]
Yeah, you bought them!
I don't think I like this
proposal anymore.[END]

=== 8a | 13366 | 12c ===
[POR27]
Sorry, my little teddy bear,
you already agreed to my
terms.[BRK]

And after all, verbal 
agreements are binding in
Meribia.[BRK]

But don't worry! I'll make
sure the Guild gets rebuilt,
one way or another![BRK]

[POR07]
I can't believe I agreed
to that stupid bet![BRK]

I've gotta win or I'm going
to be wed to fatty cheeks.[END]

=== 8b | 134ae | 1f9 ===
[POR27]
It's not like I'm going to
win overnight, Lemina, but
I do want to marry you.[BRK]

It's like dad always said:
'The best brides are bought 
brides.'[BRK]

And I'm beginning to think
he was right![BRK]

[POR07]
....
.....[BRK]

Don't worry, anus, it's not
like I'm going to back out
of our little bet.[BRK]

[POR27]
Lemina! You are starting to
like me!! And you've
already given me a pet name.[BRK]

Dad said if you give 'em
enough time, they'll grow
to love ya![BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! I don't love ya, and
I don't intend to lose! I'll
be back to get my money!![END]

=== 8c | 136c2 | e3 ===
[POR27]
Hello, my darling angel. Is
everything going all right
with you?[BRK]

[POR07]
Hello, anus. Don't start
gloating yet. You still 
haven't won![BRK]

[POR02]
I don't see you trying to
win the bet, Lemina.[BRK]

Maybe you secretly long to
be Ramus' wife.[END]

=== 8d | 137b8 | ab ===
Hello <hick> my lovely
little <hick> girl!![BRK]

Did ya bring anything 
that'll <hick> please an
old man?[BRK]

[POR07]
He's nothing more than a
drunken gambler! Kind of
like you, Ronfar.[END]

=== 8e | 1387a | 139 ===
I haven't <hick> seen you
in a long time, Lemina.[BRK]

Did you sneak any wine from
the town of Wine past Ramus?[BRK]

[POR07]
That's Vane, Grandpa, and
no, I didn't bring you any
wine![BRK]

It's weird. Every tenth boy
in Ramus' family is named
Ramus.[BRK]

They're kinda stuck on the 
name, since the first Ramus
knew Dragonmaster Alex.[END]

=== 8f | 139c6 | 97 ===
I think Junior is going
to kick me out of this
place![BRK]

He's mad that I made that
big hole in the wall.[BRK]

I though it might lead to a
secret wine cellar...[END]

=== 90 | 13a74 | ea ===
Good job, Junior! This
business is really starting
to take off![BRK]

I think I'm going to go
inspect some of the
merchandise...[BRK]

[POR27]
Grandpa, last time you did
that, we were stuck with a
huge lawsuit![BRK]

That's why we almost lost
this store!![END]

=== 91 | 13b7a | 6b ===
That stupid grandson of mine
won't even let me inspect 
the employees...[BRK]

I really hate that kid 
sometimes.[END]

=== 92 | 13bf8 | 82 ===
I hope Ramus makes this 
store as great as it was
originally.[BRK]

That's when we had all the
money, and I could do 
whatever I wanted![END]

=== 93 | 13c92 | 105 ===
Hello, my new granddaughter!
Ramus told me you two were
going to get married.[BRK]

I can't wait for that kid to
have some children of his
own...[BRK]

[POR07]
Wait! Wait a minute!! 
I never agreed to this![BRK]

Ramus hasn't won yet,
Grandpa.[BRK]

Who knows? I still might be
able to win.[END]

=== 94 | 13db2 | 92 ===
I've decided that I'm going
to help Ramus win that 
little bet of his...[BRK]

Welcome to the family, my
dear! You're going to make
Ramus one happy man.[END]

=== 95 | 13e60 | 170 ===
I told Ramus to shower you
with gifts, and to make sure
they were the finest.[BRK]

Everyone knows that a woman
will marry any man that
buys them stuff.[BRK]

[POR02]
They've found your weak
spot, Lemina! What are you
going to do with the gifts?[BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! Just because a man 
buys a woman something 
doesn't mean they'll wed.[BRK]

I'm just going to take the
gifts and sell them for 
money![END]

=== 96 | 13fe0 | 9a ===
When I was tending the store
last night, I heard crying
coming from behind the wall.[BRK]

I'm so scared, I can't even
go to the bathroom by myself
at night.[END]

=== 97 | 1408e | 9c ===
This place is really 
starting to give me the
creeps.[BRK]

Just look! The wall fell
down over there![BRK]

What's next? Man, I sure
hope it doesn't start oozing
blood![END]

=== 98 | 1413e | 6d ===
There's no way in hell that
I'll ever go down in that
creepfest of a hole![BRK]

Yes, I'm a coward and proud
of it![END]

=== 99 | 141ba | a0 ===
Ramus is such a genius! He's
taken this store and turned
it into a Silver mine.[BRK]

I've received three raises
in the last week![BRK]

I'm finally going to be a
rich man![END]

All of my family have worked

Listen up, kiddies! Long ago
Taben's Peak was a fortress

Last time, I went away to

I don't like it...[END]

Lunn decided not to allow
the construction of a shrine

He wanted all the power and

That man is evil! I can feel

Is there enough kick left in

Well, I went and signed up

Trouble was...[BRK]

my kicks.[BRK]

They finally told me just
to leave...[END]

[POR10]
Oh, that's so sad...and
there's no excuse for it![BRK]

My grandma's wraps didn't

Meribia has been a very

In fact, this town has

I think it has something to

location.[END]

It's wonderful![END]

The rush of the Tunnels of
Carnage is incredible! You

that it's all so real![BRK]

And even better, it's

That should pull in the

When I was a child, Ramus'
store was much larger than
it is now.[BRK]

Back then, the owner was
a guy named Grant. He ruined
the place's reputation.[BRK]

His son, Ramus the 6th, is
trying to salvage the family
business.[BRK]

I'm pullin' for him...[END]

I still am not sure that
Ramus has the skill to save
the store.[END]

off saving the store![BRK]

I hope for the town's sake
that he does. We need a
place like his...[END]

I tried Ramus' new ride.[BRK]

What's the big deal?! It's
just the sewers, for god's
sake![BRK]

He just is letting people
walk around in the stinky
town sewers![BRK]

They've been there forever!
What's so exciting about
that?[BRK]

Really! P.T. Barnum Junior

So you've come to learn from

This is Master Lunn's dojo. 
He's upstairs tending to 
important business.[BRK]

If you've come to sign up
for lessons, I don't think
he's accepting new students.[END]

=== 10a | 1c52a | 84 ===
Taben's Peak? Well, it's to
the east of Meribia...[BRK]

But if I were you, I'd stay
away from that place. The 
bandits take no prisoners.[END]

=== 10b | 1c5c2 | 73 ===
Lunn built this dojo to 
encourage people to study 
the martial arts.[BRK]

Some say he's the best 
teacher in the world.[END]

=== 10c | 1c648 | bb ===
Master Lunn isn't in Meribia
at the moment.[BRK]

He was summoned to the holy 
city Pentagulia by the 
goddess.[BRK]

There must be trouble in the
world if she's requested 
Lunn to come and help her.[END]

=== 10d | 1c716 | 43 ===
Master Lunn is not in at 
this time. May I take a 
message for him?[END]

=== 10e | 1c768 | 86 ===
I'm sorry, but Master Lunn
still hasn't returned to
Meribia.[BRK]

He's probably off saving the
world from evil.  Lunn is 
just a great guy![END]

=== 10f | 1c7fe | b9 ===
It seems that the bandits of
Taben's Peak have blocked 
the path leading to Vane.[BRK]

But they're afraid of
Master Lunn.[BRK]

I think he's going to go 
there and put an end to 
their rebellion.[END]

=== 110 | 1c8ca | 8b ===
Master Lunn has made sure
that the peace in this 
district is maintained.[BRK]

He's even had to crack a few
skulls to get his peace plan
across![END]

=== 111 | 1c964 | b6 ===
I've heard the bandits of
Taben's Peak have enlisted
children to fight for them.[BRK]

What kind of sick person 
would cause children to 
fight in a war??[BRK]

[POR02]
Evidently, a REALLY sick 
one![END]

=== 112 | 1ca2e | a6 ===
Some say Lunn was born to 
fight...[BRK]

Others say it's because he
got tired of being beaten
up when he was a kid.[BRK]

I think Lunn just likes to
beat the crap out of people![END]

=== 113 | 1caec | 86 ===
I'm training so that I can
go with Lunn to Taben's
Peak.[BRK]

I just want to go with him
and watch him beat the 
snot out of those bandits.[END]

=== 114 | 1cb8a | 94 ===
I think it's going to be so
fun to watch Lunn fight in
actual combat.[BRK]

I can just see him pounding 
on those bandits, beating
them into the ground...[END]

=== 115 | 1cc3a | 45 ===
I don't know why Lunn takes
such delight in beating up
us new guys...[END]

=== 116 | 1cc92 | 6d ===
I think Master Lunn is way
too busy to train all of us.[BRK]

His business for the Goddess
keeps him really busy...[END]

=== 117 | 1cd0e | 95 ===
Many people think that Lunn
should be given the title
of 'Holy Karate Master'...[BRK]

I don't know if Lunn would
accept such a self-serving
title as that.[END]

=== 118 | 1cdb0 | 1f ===
[POR10]
Somehow, I think he
would...[END]

=== 119 | 1cde2 | a6 ===
I heard a nasty little rumor
that Master Lunn isn't going
to continue to train us...[BRK]

If Master Lunn doesn't want
to train us, then I don't 
know what I'm going to do.[END]

=== 11a | 1cea0 | 80 ===
I'm thinking about quitting
this whole karate thing...[BRK]

It's been kind of boring 
since they started the new
safer-kinder karate.[END]

=== 11b | 1cf34 | 7f ===
My dad says he remembers 
when you could just beat
the crap out of people.[BRK]

He said that's the best kind
of karate in the world![END]

=== 11c | 1cfc6 | 7e ===
People say that you should
learn karate for self-
defense...[BRK]

Then why is it that we spend
so much time on offensive
maneuvers?[END]

=== 11d | 1d05c | 114 ===
I've heard all about you,
Jean, but I thought it was
just a rumor...[BRK]

Since Master Lunn isn't due
back for awhile, do you 
think you could train us?[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sorry, but I just don't
believe in teaching people
how to fight...[BRK]

I only fight because I have
to, not because I want to.[END]

=== 11e | 1d18c | bd ===
Sure you only fight because
you have to...[BRK]

That's why your skills are 
nearly perfected! I don't
think so.[BRK]

You don't want to teach me
because you're afraid that
I'll become better than you.[END]

=== 11f | 1d25c | 96 ===
Please don't disturb any of
the fighters. They're in the
middle of a special session.[BRK]

It's designed to prepare

tournament.[END]

Horam!?
That town has nothing but
bad memories for me...[END]

We've never lost a match

training us.[BRK]

Every victory we win is a
testament to his great
teaching skills.[END]

Lunn travels all over the
place...[BRK]

He goes to Pentagulia to
meet with the Goddess,[BRK]

then he goes to Horam to 
check on that city, and then
back here to Meribia.[END]

Lunn left me in charge of
their training.[BRK]

I have to make sure that
these guys practice at least
18 hours every day.[END]

it's kinda hard for you to

I can't believe I'm creamin'
this guy! He's such a waste
of my skills![BRK]

Your practice shouldn't be 
filled with actual fighting![BRK]

You should want to help the

effective![END]

Don't talk to me while I'm

Dammit! You just broke my

Didn't you hear me the first

Geez. Remember that next

Haaaaaaayy-yaaaaaaa![BRK]

Kinda makes you scared 
hearing me scream like that,

Master Lunn, my name is

But I was also taught the
Black Karate of Death...[BRK]

I'm sure you're aware that
this type of karate was used
for assassination.[BRK]

[POR16]
Black Karate of Death?!
Assassination!?[BRK]

I've never heard anything 
like this before...[BRK]

[POR10]
I know. For the person who
created this karate remains
a mystery to me.[BRK]

He is a coward that hides
behind a mask so that no one
may learn his true identity.[BRK]

A long time ago I was
enslaved to his wicked
group, but I escaped...[BRK]

He calls his devilish sect
the Blue Dragon Cult,[BRK]

but his teachings are far
removed from the light of
the Blue Dragon.[BRK]

He must be stopped.[BRK]

[POR16]
Jean, thank you for bringing
this matter to my attention.[BRK]

I cannot forgive anyone that
would train another in the
ways of such evil.[BRK]

I will find this masked man
and put an end to his reign
of terror![BRK]

It is rumored that the Blue
Dragon Cult is located near
Taben's Peak...[BRK]

I believe that these may be
the same 'bandits' that are
attacking people there.[BRK]

Jean, I would like to make
a request of you...[BRK]

Go to Taben's Peak and
search for a link between
the bandits and this 'cult.'[BRK]

Once you find their hideout,
I will lead an attack on it.[BRK]

Know this: I will bring
them to justice.[BRK]

One way or another...[BRK]

[POR10]
I will do all that you have
requested of me! Thank you,
Master Lunn.[END]

=== 139 | 1edd4 | 217 ===
[POR16]
Jean, you do not dress like
someone who practices 
karate.[BRK]

[POR10]
After I escaped from the
Blue Dragon Cult, I swore
never to use karate...[BRK]

I'm still torn as to the
path I should take, however.[BRK]

[POR16]
You must realize that karate
is not evil. Only the weak
use karate in evil ways.[BRK]

There is nothing wrong with
you using karate as long as
you use it correctly.[BRK]

Jean...Come--train under
my watchful eye...[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[BRK]

Please, I need time to think
about your offer...[BRK]

But for now I'm going to go
to Taben's Peak to find this
masked terror![END]

=== 13a | 1f006 | eb ===
[POR16]
Have you finally decided if
you're going to accept my 
offer and train with me?[BRK]

[POR10]
Lunn, I still need time to 
think about it...[BRK]

I don't know if I want to
devote my life to fighting,[BRK]

when dance gives me the
power to be truly free...[END]

=== 13b | 1f100 | 65 ===
Lunn is well respected
by everyone in Meribia.[BRK]

He has worked hard to make
this city a peaceful haven.[END]

=== 13c | 1f178 | ce ===
I've worked so closely with
Master Lunn during the last
few years...[BRK]

that I have devoted myself
to continue in his 
footsteps.[BRK]

I hope that Master Lunn will
pick me to join him in any
of his future missions.[END]

=== 13d | 1f25a | 5c ===
I'm still practicing my
karate...[BRK]

But Master Lunn said that I
need to exercise my brain
too.[END]

=== 13e | 1f2c6 | 85 ===
I've decided that the really
powerful people have great
minds.[BRK]

I've decided that I'm going
to train my mind before I
work on my body.[END]

=== 13f | 1f358 | 6c ===
[POR02]
From my vantage point, I 
think you should invest
some time in that body.[BRK]

Perhaps 'Deal a Meal'
can help?[END]

=== 140 | 1f3d8 | 84 ===
Some say that Master Lunn is
as strong as Lord Leo.[BRK]

I think that if they ever 
fought, we'd have one hell
of a pay-per-view special.[END]

=== 141 | 1f474 | 53 ===
I would like to be Lunn's
fight promoter.[BRK]

I would become filthy rich
promoting him.[END]

=== 142 | 1f4e2 | 5f ===
I'm tired of promoting these
little guys.[BRK]

It's a waste of time and
there's no money to be
made.[END]

=== 143 | 1f550 | 7b ===
I tell ya, you only get
one chance at fame![BRK]

Too bad some try to stay
in the spotlight long after
their welcome is worn out.[END]

=== 144 | 1f5de | 8e ===
I can't believe that Master
Lunn is able to do all his
work for the Goddess...[BRK]

...and still have time to
train us all in the ways of
karate.[END]

=== 145 | 1f684 | 34 ===
I'm trying to be a great
master of karate like Lunn.[END]

=== 146 | 1f6d0 | 51 ===
You should've seen me last
night! I really kicked the
stuffing out of this guy...[END]

=== 147 | 1f73c | 50 ===
The tournament in Horam is
coming up in the next few
weeks. I've gotta practice.[END]

=== 148 | 1f79c | 95 ===
I really want to go to 
lunch, but the new guy won't
be here for another hour...[BRK]

I'm going to talk to my boss
and see if I can work the 
night shift.[END]

=== 149 | 1f844 | 91 ===
I really hate studying about
the Four Heroes in school...[BRK]

History-schmistery...It's
all just boring crap about
old farts![BRK]

Who needs to know that?[END]

=== 14a | 1f8ec | 7e ===
We just started learning 
about Dragonmaster Alex and
his companions...[BRK]

I'm starting to warm up to
this whole history thing...[END]

=== 14b | 1f982 | cc ===
I learned that Dragonmaster
Alex was just a kid like me,[BRK]

but he was chosen by the
White Dragon to become the
next Dragonmaster...[BRK]

...and save our world from
evil. Whooo...Dragonmasters
seem soooo cool..[END]

=== 14c | 1fa5c | 3a ===
[POR10]
I wonder what ever became 
of the last Dragonmaster...?[END]

=== 14d | 1fab2 | 43 ===
Some say that there's a
new Dragonmaster that
protects the Goddess.[END]

=== 14e | 1fb08 | ce ===
History is really starting
to become boring again...[BRK]

We've started learning about
the stupid Blue Star and how
our ancestors came here...[BRK]

I'd rather be studying about
the Four Dragons and the
Dragonmasters.[END]

=== 14f | 1fbe6 | 69 ===
Master Lunn said I should
study harder in school...[BRK]

He's starting to sound just
like my stupid parents...[END]

=== 150 | 1fc5e | 84 ===
Master Lunn is in his 
private chambers right now.[BRK]

He is listening to all of 
our problems. If you've got
a problem, go talk to him.[END]

=== 151 | 1fcfa | d1 ===
Master Lunn's karate draws
on the teachings of several
different styles.[BRK]

He's trying to develop the
most powerful karate ever
known to man.[BRK]

Don't let his quest for 
power fool ya. He's really 
got a big heart.[END]

=== 152 | 1fde6 | 7c ===
Last time I checked, Lunn
was in there, but then
again,[BRK]

he has been known to sneak
outta here quietly, if ya
get my drift...[END]

=== 153 | 1fe72 | 74 ===
Lunn has taken over the 
town of Horam.[BRK]

That's the town where only
the most dedicated students
go to study karate...[END]

=== 154 | 1fefe | a5 ===
Lunn won't be back for a
long time.[BRK]

The Goddess Althena made a
request that he go to 
Pentagulia...[BRK]

I'm sure he won't be back
until he's solved that 
little problem.[END]

=== 155 | 1ffbe | 8b ===
If something is troubling
you, my child, you can
discuss it with me.[BRK]

Don't worry. As a priest,
I cannot tell anyone what
you've told me.[END]

=== 156 | 20058 | 7d ===
The Goddess Althena taught
us that humans have true
power...[BRK]

...and that power can be
used to overcome almost any
obstacle...[END]

[POR10]
Master Lunn, my name is 
Jean. I, too, am fluid in
the Way of the Blue Dragon.[BRK]

But I was also taught the
Black Karate of Death...[BRK]

I'm sure you're aware that
this type of karate was used
for assassination.[BRK]

[POR16]
Black Karate of Death?!
Assassination!?[BRK]

I've never heard anything 
like this before...[BRK]

[POR10]
I know. For the person who
created this karate remains
a mystery to me.[BRK]

He is a coward that hides
behind a mask so that no one
may learn his true identity.[BRK]

A long time ago I was
enslaved to his wicked
group, but I escaped...[BRK]

He calls his devilish sect
