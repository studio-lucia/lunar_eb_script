All right now, Hiro...[BRK]

Before you start your
adventure, be sure to touch
the statue of Althena.[BRK]

If you do, it will wipe
fatigue from your body and
give you strength anew.[END]

=== 1 | 9030 | 9c ===
[POR04]
Well then, Hiro, let's get
started toward the Blue
Spire.[BRK]

We need to see what's going
on around here.[BRK]

Head that way...across the
bridge and to the north.[END]

Okay, m'boy, the boat's
all ready.[BRK]

Hopefully you'll be able
to find a way to help
Lucia...[BRK]

[POR02]
But Grandpa Gwyn! Aren't
you going with us?[BRK]

[POR04]
Lord no, little one! I'm
just too old for this sort
of thing now.[BRK]

[POR01]
But Grandpa![BRK]

[POR04]
No 'buts' about it, young
man. I can't make the
trip![BRK]

You'll do fine. I've taught
you well, and you're a
bright boy.[BRK]

Besides, I've got a million
books to catch up on...Now
get moving![BRK]

Remember, seek out Ronfar
when you get to Larpa![END]

...But the Blue Spire has
been a mystery for decades,
even hundreds of years...[BRK]

You can't possibly expect
that I know all its secrets![BRK]

Besides, what interest could
you possibly have at the
Spire?[BRK]

[POR09]
Blue stars, secret riddles!
Pah! What an easy life you
lead, archaeologist![BRK]

My work is much more serious
than that. A destroyer is
coming to our world.[BRK]

...And the Blue Spire is
the point at which it will
originate![BRK]

Goddess Althena has given me
direct orders to eradicate
the destroyer.[BRK]

[POR04]
The Goddess Althena? A devil
at the Tower of Blue? Bah!
Nonsense...[BRK]

[POR09]
Regardless of whether you
believe me or not, I need
your help...[BRK]

We attempted to enter the
tower, but it was sealed
with some kind of magic.[BRK]

We must find a way to
enter the Blue Spire.[BRK]

And since you are the
'expert' on it,[BRK]

you and you alone can
provide the answers I seek.[END]

She needs rest...We must lay
her down somewhere...[END]

[POR04]
Ah, this will do nicely!
OK, Hiro, you stay here
with Lucia.[BRK]

I'll go downstairs and see
if there's a book that shows
how to break the curse.[END]

=== a | b00e | 42 ===
Althena created the
Priesthood to govern the
world in her absence.[END]

Lord Leo is the top crusader
for Goddess Althena.[BRK]

He is one of her Four
Heroes. The destroyer
doesn't stand a chance![END]

=== c | b0f4 | b7 ===
It is foretold that the
destroyer will appear north
of the Salyan Desert.[BRK]

Goddess Althena said it was
coming to the Blue Spire.[BRK]

Even if the destroyer
escapes, Lord Leo will find
it...[END]

=== d | b1c2 | 92 ===
The Blue Spire is rumored to
be filled with all kinds of
frightening monsters.[BRK]

In fact, no one is said to
look upon the destroyer's
face and live![END]

=== e | b26c | be ===
[POR09]
Ah! Hiro, I knew I'd run
into you again.[BRK]

Say, your grandfather Gwyn
says he doesn't know any-
thing about a destroyer.[BRK]

Being such a skilled arch-
aeologist, I find that hard
to believe...[END]

=== f | b342 | ec ===
[POR09]
Doesn't it seem odd that
Gwyn doesn't know anything
about a destroyer,[BRK]

when he's devoted his life
to unlocking the secrets of
the Blue Spire?[BRK]

[POR02]
No odder than you being
35 and never having a
girlfriend![BRK]

People are starting to
talk...[END]

=== 10 | b442 | 237 ===
[POR09]
Hiro, I know a good man
when I see one...[BRK]

[POR02]
I bet you do...[BRK]

[POR09]
Was I talking to you?[BRK]

Anyway, as I was saying, I
know a good man when I see
one.[BRK]

Why don't you quit this old
archaeology thing and come
to work in Althena's Guard?[BRK]

[POR02]
Why would Hiro want to trade
freedom for servitude? He
won't work for you![BRK]

[POR09]
You are starting to get on
my nerves, little one.[BRK]

Didn't you ever learn to
speak only when spoken to?[BRK]

Hiro, it's an open offer, so
just keep it in mind.[BRK]

Oh, for your safety, you
should stay away from the
Blue Spire.[BRK]

A big battle's coming. I can
feel it...[END]

=== 11 | b682 | 160 ===
[POR04]
My, my! He was an arrogant
fop, wasn't he?[BRK]

I can't believe that the
Goddess has come to us
again as a human...[BRK]

...and is giving orders
directly to Lord Leo...[BRK]

...Very strange, it's not
s'posed to...And this...
this...destroyer thing...[BRK]

...Something's up, m'boy,
that's for certain. And I
don't like the smell of it![BRK]

Not one bit...No, not
one...[END]

=== 12 | b7ec | 6c ===
[POR04]
Oh dear! Hiro! Hiro, m'boy!
Come quick![BRK]

Something's happening at
the...the...[BRK]

...............Hurry, lad![END]

=== 13 | b870 | 2a9 ===
[POR02]
We're home, Grandpa Gwyn![BRK]

[POR04]
Ah, yes...Welcome back,
kids! We have guests today![BRK]

This is Lord Leo, Chief of
Althena's Guard. He wants to
know about the Blue Spire.[BRK]

[POR09]
Yes, and as I was about to
explain, I don't have time
for a history lesson.[BRK]

All I want to know is one
simple thing...How does one
enter the tower?[BRK]

The entrance has apparently
been sealed for generations.[BRK]

[POR04]
Ah, yes, well...That is...
That's the million Silver
question, isn't it?[BRK]

I'm not exactly sure, but
it seems to me that if one
were to take the...[BRK]

[POR09]
I don't have the time to
act on hunches, old man! If
you don't know the way in,[BRK]

I'll just have to destroy
the whole spire with the
Destiny's Dragon Cannon![END]

=== 14 | bb34 | c7 ===
[POR04]
Hiro, have you been off at
the Dragon Ruins again?[BRK]

I've told you time and again
to stay away from that
place![BRK]

It's plumb full of monsters,
and very dangerous if you're
unsure of what you're doing.[END]

=== 15 | bc16 | cb ===
[POR04]
Hiro, I'm telling you to
stay away from those Dragon
Ruins![BRK]

[POR02]
...Uhmm, Hiro, let's not
tell him about the jewel we
found, okay?[BRK]

I think he'd pop a cork if
he knew what we actually
did at the ruins...[END]

=== 16 | bcf8 | 105 ===
[POR04]
Hmmm...Oh, bother! What did
I do with that...jewel?[BRK]

...It's got to be...around
here....somewhere...Ah! 
Hiro...[BRK]

Go down into the basement
and get some weapons while
I look for the jewel...[BRK]

And don't dally! We've got
to get over to the Blue
Spire immediately![END]

=== 17 | be18 | d2 ===
[POR04]
Confound it, boy! Are you
deaf? Listen up. I'll tell
you again...[BRK]

Trot down to the library
and get us some weapons
to take along.[BRK]

And be mindful of the time!
Don't dawdle! We've got to
get to the Blue Spire![END]

=== 18 | befe | e2 ===
[POR04]
Ah! I knew I put it away for
safekeeping, and here it is![BRK]

If we put this jewel in the
eye of the dragon at the
entrance, it should open![BRK]

Here, put this in your bag,
Hiro.[BRK]

Received the Left Dragon 
Eye Jewel from Gwyn.[END]

=== 19 | bfea | af ===
[POR04]
Be sure to equip the weapon
you took from the chest.[BRK]

It's no use to us in your
bag, m'boy.[BRK]

Okay, let's get moving. The
Blue Spire's to the north,
after we cross the bridge.[END]

I...Ahhhh...oooo...
......Nooooo...![BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro, Leo says that Lucia
is a destroyer. Do you think
she really is?[BRK]

[POR02]
L...Lucia...?[BRK]

[POR08]

...This world will cease to
exist if Zophar...is...not
...stopped...[BRK]

...For the sake of the
humans here...I...must...
...stop him...[END]

=== 1c | c204 | bb ===
[POR02]
Humans? Lucia, why did you
say that? Y...You mean to
say you're not human?[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

...I...am...unghh...[BRK]

[POR04]
Hiro, it appears that this
curse is beyond anything I
can cure myself.[END]

=== 1d | c2c8 | 170 ===
[POR04]
We're going to have to find
a priest with special
training to dispel it.[BRK]

...I think that there's a
priest by the name of Ronfar
in the village of Larpa.[BRK]

Used to know his father...
he's a good kid. Maybe he
can help us.[BRK]

You must take Lucia to him,
Hiro. Since Larpa is on the
other side of the sea,[BRK]

you'll need my boat. I've
got everything ready. Meet
me outside...[END]

=== 1e | c442 | 255 ===
[POR02]
Okay, Lucia, just so we're
straight on a few things,
I'll tell you this:[BRK]

Hiro is helping you out
'cause he's a nice guy, but
he's all mine.[BRK]

Got that? I don't want you
moving in on my territory.[BRK]

[POR08]
...What...What do you mean
by that? I...I don't un...
understand...[BRK]

[POR02]
I mean you shouldn't get too
close to Hiro, because you'd
set yourself up for a fall.[BRK]

[POR08]
Oh...does Hiro...trip
people that...get too close?[BRK]

I'll remember to...walk ten
paces...behind him.[BRK]

[POR02]
No, no, no! That's not what
I'm talking about![BRK]

You're so dense, you can't
possibly be a threat to my
love for Hiro.[BRK]

Let's just go![END]

Hiro, Lucia is still in the
throes of the curse! Why
have you come back here?[BRK]

You need to get to Larpa and
seek out Ronfar, not piddle
around here.[BRK]

Get moving, m'boy! Lucia's
life is at stake![END]

=== 23 | d034 | ee ===
[POR04]
Hiro! You've returned...but
where is Lucia?[BRK]

...Well, if she's lost, you
had better find her! If Leo
finds her, she's dead.[BRK]

That naive girl needs some
sort of escort to watch out
for her, m'boy![BRK]

So what are you waiting
for? Go find her![END]

=== 24 | d13e | 7b ===
[POR04]
You're a fine young man, and
as good as any to watch over
Lucia...[BRK]

Ah, my dear! The curse must
have been broken. You look

[POR08]
Yes, the curse was broken.
Thank you for all the kind-
ness you've shown me, Gwyn.[BRK]

[POR04]
Bah! Don't mention it, young
lady. I couldn't have slept
at night if I hadn't helped.[BRK]

I just hope you find Althena
and finish what you've come
to accomplish.[END]

=== 26 | d330 | ad ===
[POR04]
Hiro, you had better stick
with Lucia until she finds
Althena.[BRK]

I don't think her task will

for, m'boy? Go find her![END]

We've got to do something
to help her![END]

...How did this happen?[END]

=== 29 | d566 | c1 ===
[POR08]
It was my fault, Gwyn. He
did it to save my life. But
...I...[BRK]

[POR04]
Yes, that sounds like the
crazy boy![BRK]

Always trying to save the
world.[BRK]

And now look at the fine
mess it's gotten him into![END]

=== 2a | d636 | 89 ===
[POR08]
I'm sorry, Gwyn. It's my
fault. He tried to save my
life...[BRK]

But I promise. One way or
another, I will return the
favor and revive him![END]

=== 2b | d6d2 | bc ===
[POR04]
Ohh, Hiro! What's happened
to you, m'boy?[BRK]

If only I could take your
place...You have so much to
live for...[BRK]

[POR08]
Gwyn, Hiro did this to save
my life. I will find some
way to save his...[END]

=== 2c | d7a2 | 77 ===
[POR04]
Ahh! Hiro, m'boy! Back to
your old self I see![BRK]

For a while there, you had
me very worried. Shame on
you! He he he...[END]

=== 2d | d83c | 12b ===
[POR04]
I have no idea where you
will find the jewel for
the dragon's right eye...[BRK]

You see, m'boy, I purchased
the other eye from a
traveling merchant ages ago.[BRK]

Confound it all! You see...
he told me where he got it,[BRK]

but that was so long ago
I've forgotten the story![BRK]

Perhaps Nall would have
some idea...[END]

=== 2e | d98e | fa ===
[POR04]
Oh, don't worry 'bout me,
lad! I've got all these
books to keep me company![BRK]

Lucia doesn't have anything
of the sort on the Blue Star
to keep her company...[BRK]

Hiro, you must try to get
to her on the Blue Star at
any cost...[BRK]

You two belong together...[END]

=== 2f | dab0 | 11e ===
[POR04]
Hiro, you should be able to
get to the Blue Star from
the Star Dragon's Tower.[BRK]

But to get into the tower,
you need two Dragon Eye
Jewels...[BRK]

I know you can find the
jewels if you set your mind
to it, m'boy![BRK]

Go to it. Lucia's waiting![BRK]

Perhaps Nall knows where you
can start looking...[END]

=== 30 | dbfc | 65 ===
[POR04]
Ah! Hiro, m'boy! Good work!
You found one of the Dragon
Eyes![BRK]

I knew it was around here
somewhere![END]

=== 31 | dc68 | 96 ===
[POR04]
There must be a matching
Dragon Eye Jewel somewhere
in this world.[BRK]

Hiro, you must find the
other one![BRK]

Think! You must have some
idea where to look![END]

=== 32 | dd1a | db ===
[POR04]
Ahh! I knew you wouldn't let
Lucia down, m'boy! You found
the other Dragon Jewel![BRK]

Take the two jewels to the
Star Dragon's Spire in the
Salyan Desert.[BRK]

With those two jewels, you
should be able to unlock the
entrance.[END]

=== 33 | de08 | 14d ===
[POR04]
At the top level of the
Star Dragon's Tower is a
Dragon Crystal.[BRK]

You can use the power of
that crystal to get to the
Blue Star.[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

Thank you, Grandpa. I...I'll
never forget you...[BRK]

[POR04]
Bah! No sappy words now,
m'boy![BRK]

There's a girl waiting out
there who truly loves you,
and that's a rare thing.[BRK]

Go to her, Hiro...[END]

=== 34 | df6c | ae ===
[POR04]
Hiro, don't make this any
harder than it has to be,
m'boy![BRK]

You've got true love in your
reach! Seize it and never
let go![BRK]

Now...Get out of here...
Lucia's waiting for you.[END]

=== 35 | e02e | 1b8 ===
[POR04]
Young man, you asked me how
to get to the Blue Star, and
I think I have the answer.[BRK]

I believe it has to do with
a crystal at the top of the
Star Dragon's Tower.[BRK]

But to gain entrance, you
need to use the same tech-
nique as at the Blue Spire.[BRK]

That is, you must find two
special Dragon Jewels that
control its door.[BRK]

Finding the two jewels to
gain entrance into the tower
is your only chance of...[BRK]

seeing Lucia again. You must
try, m'boy![END]

=== 36 | e1f4 | 10f ===
[POR04]
Hiro, those Dragon Wings of
yours seem to have great
power![BRK]

I was reading about them in
some ancient writings at the
ruins...[BRK]

It seems they can transport
you from inside any dungeon
to the outside instantly.[BRK]

They should be very useful
in finding the Dragon Eye
Jewels.[END]

I've lived near the Spire
for a 'coon's age,[BRK]

and I've never in all my
years seen anything quite
like this.[BRK]

I wonder if a destroyer has
come to our world, as Leo
has been saying?[BRK]

If that's true, then we're
all going to be in a mess
of trouble.[BRK]

[POR01]
Then I'd better go to the
Blue Spire and see just
what's happened.[BRK]

[POR04]
What?! Have you been taken
with a fit of insanity?[BRK]

If that is a destroyer in
that tower, he'll make short
work of you![BRK]

[POR01]
But Grandfather, we have to
know so we can warn Leo![BRK]

[POR04]
Ah...yes, I suppose you do
have a point there...[BRK]

Well, then, go get my
weapons in the basement,[BRK]

and I'll get the things
we'll need from the house.[BRK]

I'm not letting you go in
that place by yourself,
that's for certain...[END]

going to the Blue Spire is
such a good idea?[BRK]

I mean, what if there is a
destroyer in there now?[BRK]

=== 43 | f262 | 96 ===

Hiro? What's wrong with you?[BRK]

You walked right past
Grandpa Gwyn without saying
a word![BRK]

He might need your help
dealing with Lord Leo! Shame
on you![END]

=== 44 | f30c | ab ===
[POR02]
Hiro, it was kind of rude
of you to run off when
Leo started shouting![BRK]

You left Grandpa there all
alone to deal with him![BRK]

C'mon! Let's go see if we
can calm Leo down...[END]

=== 45 | f3ca | a3 ===
[POR02]
Hiro, I'm afraid of what
we'll find in the Blue
Spire.[BRK]

I hope Grandpa knows what
he's doing![BRK]

Because I've got a bad vibe
about this whole thing...[BRK]

something would happen at

It all began here...It seems
like such a long time ago.[BRK]

Before we met Lucia. Before
Nall showed up. Before we

And before I matured into
full dragonhood...[BRK]

It's time to go forward now.
We've got a responsibility
to our world.[BRK]

Hrmph! Imagine that! Us with
responsibility! I never
thought I'd see the day![BRK]

But no time for misty-
