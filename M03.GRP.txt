All right now, hiro...[BRK]

Before you start your
adventure, be sure to touch
the statue of althena.[BRK]

If you do, it will wipe
fatigue from your body and
give you strength anew.[END]

=== 1 | 9030 | 9c ===
[POR04]
Well then, hiro, let's get
started toward the blue
spire.[BRK]

We need to see what's going
on around here.[BRK]

Head that way...across the
bridge and to the north.[END]

Okay, m'boy, the boat's
all ready.[BRK]

Hopefully you'll be able
to find a way to help
lucia...[BRK]

[POR02]
But grandpa gwyn! Aren't
you going with us?[BRK]

[POR04]
Lord no, little one! I'm
just too old for this sort
of thing now.[BRK]

[POR01]
But grandpa![BRK]

[POR04]
No 'buts' about it, young
man. I can't make the
trip![BRK]

You'll do fine. I've taught
you well, and you're a
bright boy.[BRK]

Besides, i've got a million
books to catch up on...now
get moving![BRK]

Remember, seek out ronfar
when you get to larpa!

...but the blue spire has
been a mystery for decades,
even hundreds of years...[BRK]

You can't possibly expect
that i know all its secrets![BRK]

Besides, what interest could
you possibly have at the
spire?[BRK]

[POR09]
Blue stars, secret riddles!
Pah! What an easy life you
lead, archaeologist![BRK]

My work is much more serious
than that. A destroyer is
coming to our world.[BRK]

...and the blue spire is
the point at which it will
originate![BRK]

Goddess althena has given me
direct orders to eradicate
the destroyer.[BRK]

[POR04]
The goddess althena? A devil
at the tower of blue? Bah!
Nonsense...[BRK]

[POR09]
Regardless of whether you
believe me or not, i need
your help...[BRK]

We attempted to enter the
tower, but it was sealed
with some kind of magic.[BRK]

We must find a way to
enter the blue spire.[BRK]

And since you are the
'expert' on it,[BRK]

you and you alone can
provide the answers i seek.

Ah, this will do nicely!
Ok, hiro, you stay here

I'll go downstairs and see
if there's a book that shows
how to break the curse.

Lord leo is the top crusader

He is one of her four
heroes. The destroyer
doesn't stand a chance![END]

It is foretold that the
destroyer will appear north
of the salyan desert.[BRK]

Goddess althena said it was
coming to the blue spire.[BRK]

Even if the destroyer
escapes, lord leo will find
it...[END]

The blue spire is rumored to
be filled with all kinds of
frightening monsters.[BRK]

In fact, no one is said to
look upon the destroyer's
face and live![END]

[POR09]
Ah! Hiro, i knew i'd run
into you again.[BRK]

Say, your grandfather gwyn
says he doesn't know any-
thing about a destroyer.[BRK]

Being such a skilled arch-
aeologist, i find that hard
to believe...[END]

=== f | b342 | ec ===
[POR09]
Doesn't it seem odd that
gwyn doesn't know anything
about a destroyer,[BRK]

when he's devoted his life
to unlocking the secrets of
the blue spire?[BRK]

[POR02]
No odder than you being
35 and never having a
girlfriend![BRK]

People are starting to
talk...[END]

=== 10 | b442 | 237 ===
[POR09]
Hiro, i know a good man
when i see one...[BRK]

[POR02]
I bet you do...[BRK]

[POR09]
Was i talking to you?[BRK]

Anyway, as i was saying, I
know a good man when i see
one.[BRK]

Why don't you quit this old
archaeology thing and come
to work in althena's guard?[BRK]

[POR02]
Why would hiro want to trade
freedom for servitude? He
won't work for you![BRK]

[POR09]
You are starting to get on
my nerves, little one.[BRK]

Didn't you ever learn to
speak only when spoken to?[BRK]

Hiro, it's an open offer, so
just keep it in mind.[BRK]

Oh, for your safety, you
should stay away from the
blue spire.[BRK]

A big battle's coming. I can
feel it...[END]

=== 11 | b682 | 160 ===
[POR04]
My, my! He was an arrogant
fop, wasn't he?[BRK]

I can't believe that the
goddess has come to us
again as a human...[BRK]

...and is giving orders
directly to lord leo...[BRK]

...very strange, it's not
s'posed to...and this...
this...destroyer thing...[BRK]

...something's up, m'boy,
that's for certain. And I
don't like the smell of it![BRK]

Not one bit...no, not
one...

[POR04]
Oh dear! Hiro! Hiro, m'boy!
Come quick![BRK]

Something's happening at

[POR02]
We're home, grandpa gwyn![BRK]

[POR04]
Ah, yes...welcome back,
kids! We have guests today![BRK]

This is lord leo, chief of
althena's guard. He wants to
know about the blue spire.[BRK]

[POR09]
Yes, and as i was about to
explain, i don't have time
for a history lesson.[BRK]

All i want to know is one
simple thing...how does one
enter the tower?[BRK]

The entrance has apparently
been sealed for generations.[BRK]

[POR04]
Ah, yes, well...that is...
that's the million silver
question, isn't it?[BRK]

I'm not exactly sure, but
it seems to me that if one
were to take the...[BRK]

[POR09]
I don't have the time to
act on hunches, old man! If
you don't know the way in,[BRK]

i'll just have to destroy
the whole spire with the
destiny's dragon cannon![END]

=== 14 | bb34 | c7 ===
[POR04]
Hiro, have you been off at
the dragon ruins again?[BRK]

I've told you time and again
to stay away from that
place![BRK]

It's plumb full of monsters,
and very dangerous if you're
unsure of what you're doing.[END]

=== 15 | bc16 | cb ===
[POR04]
Hiro, i'm telling you to
stay away from those dragon
ruins![BRK]

[POR02]
...uhmm, hiro, let's not
tell him about the jewel we
found, okay?[BRK]

I think he'd pop a cork if
he knew what we actually
did at the ruins...[END]

=== 16 | bcf8 | 105 ===
[POR04]
Hmmm...oh, bother! What did
i do with that...jewel?[BRK]

...it's got to be...around
here....somewhere...ah! 
Hiro...[BRK]

Go down into the basement
and get some weapons while
i look for the jewel...[BRK]

And don't dally! We've got
to get over to the blue
spire immediately![END]

=== 17 | be18 | d2 ===
[POR04]
Confound it, boy! Are you
deaf? Listen up. I'll tell
you again...[BRK]

Trot down to the library
and get us some weapons
to take along.[BRK]

And be mindful of the time!
Don't dawdle! We've got to
get to the blue spire![END]

=== 18 | befe | e2 ===
[POR04]
Ah! I knew i put it away for
safekeeping, and here it is![BRK]

If we put this jewel in the
eye of the dragon at the
entrance, it should open![BRK]

Here, put this in your bag,
hiro.[BRK]

Received the left dragon 
eye jewel from gwyn.[END]

Be sure to equip the weapon
you took from the chest.[BRK]

It's no use to us in your
bag, m'boy.[BRK]

Okay, let's get moving. The
blue spire's to the north,
after we cross the bridge.[END]

say that? Y...you mean to
say you're not human?[BRK]

[POR04]
Hiro, it appears that this
curse is beyond anything I
can cure myself.
[END]

=== 1d | c2c8 | 170 ===
[POR04]
We're going to have to find
a priest with special
training to dispel it.[BRK]

...i think that there's a
priest by the name of ronfar
in the village of larpa.[BRK]

Used to know his father...
he's a good kid. Maybe he
can help us.[BRK]

You must take lucia to him,
hiro. Since larpa is on the
other side of the sea,[BRK]

you'll need my boat. I've
got everything ready. Meet
me outside...
[END]

=== 1e | c442 | 255 ===
[POR02]
Okay, lucia, just so we're
straight on a few things,
i'll tell you this:[BRK]

Hiro is helping you out
'cause he's a nice guy, but
he's all mine.[BRK]

Got that? I don't want you
moving in on my territory.[BRK]

[POR08]
...what...what do you mean
by that? I...i don't un...
understand...[BRK]

[POR02]
I mean you shouldn't get too
close to hiro, because you'd
set yourself up for a fall.[BRK]

[POR08]
Oh...does hiro...trip
people that...get too close?[BRK]

I'll remember to...walk ten
paces...behind him.[BRK]

[POR02]
No, no, no! That's not what
i'm talking about![BRK]

You're so dense, you can't
possibly be a threat to my
love for hiro.[BRK]

Let's just go!

sort of escort to watch out

[POR04]
I have no idea where you
will find the jewel for
the dragon's right eye...[BRK]

You see, m'boy, i purchased
the other eye from a
traveling merchant ages ago.[BRK]

Confound it all! You see...
he told me where he got it,[BRK]

but that was so long ago
i've forgotten the story![BRK]

Perhaps nall would have
some idea...[END]

lad! I've got all these

Hiro, you must try to get
to her on the blue star at
any cost...[BRK]

You two belong together...[END]

=== 2f | dab0 | 11e ===

Hiro, you should be able to
get to the blue star from
the star dragon's tower.[BRK]

But to get into the tower,
you need two dragon eye
jewels...[BRK]

I know you can find the
jewels if you set your mind
to it, m'boy![BRK]

Go to it. Lucia's waiting![BRK]

Perhaps nall knows where you
can start looking...

You found one of the dragon
eyes![BRK]

I knew it was around here
somewhere![END]

=== 31 | dc68 | 96 ===
[POR04]
There must be a matching
dragon eye jewel somewhere
in this world.[BRK]

Hiro, you must find the
other one![BRK]

Think! You must have some
idea where to look![END]

=== 32 | dd1a | db ===
[POR04]
Ahh! I knew you wouldn't let
lucia down, m'boy! You found
the other dragon jewel![BRK]

Take the two jewels to the
star dragon's spire in the
salyan desert.[BRK]

With those two jewels, you
should be able to unlock the
entrance.[END]

=== 33 | de08 | 14d ===

Thank you, grandpa. I...i'll
never forget you...[BRK]

Go to her, hiro...

[POR04]
Hiro, don't make this any
harder than it has to be,
m'boy![BRK]

You've got true love in your
reach! Seize it and never
let go![BRK]

Now...get out of here...
lucia's waiting for you.[END]

=== 35 | e02e | 1b8 ===
[POR04]
Young man, you asked me how
to get to the blue star, and
i think i have the answer.[BRK]

I believe it has to do with
a crystal at the top of the
star dragon's tower.[BRK]

But to gain entrance, you
need to use the same tech-
nique as at the blue spire.[BRK]

That is, you must find two
special dragon jewels that
control its door.[BRK]

Finding the two jewels to
gain entrance into the tower
is your only chance of...[BRK]

Seeing lucia again. You must
try, m'boy!

[END]

=== 36 | e1f4 | 10f ===
[POR04]
Hiro, those dragon wings of
yours seem to have great
power![BRK]

I was reading about them in
some ancient writings at the
ruins...[BRK]

It seems they can transport
you from inside any dungeon
to the outside instantly.[BRK]

They should be very useful
in finding the dragon eye
jewels.[END]

I've lived near the spire

has been saying?[BRK]

If that's true, then we're
all going to be in a mess
of trouble.[BRK]

Then i'd better go to the
blue spire and see just
what's happened.[BRK]

What?! Have you been taken
with a fit of insanity?[BRK]

If that is a destroyer in
that tower, he'll make short
work of you![BRK]

But grandfather, we have to
know so we can warn leo![BRK]

Ah...yes, i suppose you do
have a point there...[BRK]

Well, then, go get my
weapons in the basement,[BRK]

we'll need from the house.[BRK]

I'm not letting you go in
