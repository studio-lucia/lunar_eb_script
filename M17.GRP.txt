Hiro, newsflash, buddy. This
isn't the forest! Where'd
you learn to navigate?[BRK]

Your sense of direction
could use a little work.
[END]

=== 1 | 1974a | 73 ===
[POR02]
Hiro, I get the feeling this
place is very much like the
Blue Spire.[BRK]

I wonder if this gate works
the same way...[END]

=== 2 | 197d0 | 9c ===
[POR02]
Hiro, we're gonna have to
find the Dragon's Eye Jewels
to put in here.[BRK]

I'm certain that's the key
to opening this thing.[BRK]

We'd better hurry and find
it...[END]

[0xB][0][0xC]Inserted the Right Dragon
Eye Jewel.[END]

=== 4 | 198ca | 4b ===
[POR02]
Ha! Look, Hiro! We did it!
Now we can get inside.[BRK]

We're some team, huh?
[END]

[0xB][0][0xD]Inserted the Left Dragon
Eye Jewel.[END]

=== 6 | 199ac | 92 ===
This mysterious tower is
said to be filled with
wondrous treasures![BRK]

I've been trying to figure
out how to get inside, but
I think it's impossible![END]

=== 7 | 19a4e | 132 ===
Tell you what. You guys go
ahead and go in first.[BRK]

If you see any booby traps
or deadly monsters, let me
know.[BRK]

I'm into safe adventuring.
I don't want to get killed
doing this kinda stuff.[BRK]

Oh, and if you find any of
those treasures...remember,
we're splitting it 50-50![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh...yeah, right. Suuure we
are...[END]

=== 8 | 19b90 | 90 ===
I've heard rumors that the
way to the Blue Star is
hidden within this tower![BRK]

Do you think that's really
true? The Blue Star looks so
far away...[END]

=== 9 | 19c2e | d ===

....
.....[END]

=== a | 19c4e | fd ===
Black Master Zophar,
Goddess Althena, Lucia,
baywatch popularity...[BRK]

In this world there are many
things that are a mystery.[BRK]

This tower is foremost of
those. It's been here for
centuries.[BRK]

Some say it is a way to
travel to the Blue Star.
Is that possible?[END]

=== b | 19d5a | c8 ===
Our ancestors are rumored to
have come from the Blue
Star.[BRK]

One day, I hope we can
travel back there and join
our two worlds.[BRK]

[POR02]
If this tower is the link
to the Blue Star, that just
might be possible.[END]

Hmm hmm hmm...[BRK]

Welcome, my intrepid adven-
turers! Have you come
looking for the way?[BRK]

Ah, yes! The way to the Blue
Star is sealed within this
tower.[BRK]

Try to find it if you think
you have the power, but be
warned:[BRK]

Only the strongest will
survive the trial you face.[BRK]

Come to me, if you dare
to test fate![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, Hiro...are you sure this
is a good idea?[BRK]

I mean...maybe you can get
a pen pal instead...[BRK]

[POR01]
Ruby![BRK]

[POR02]
Just checking.....[END]

Ha ha ha ha![BRK]

Are you the one seeking the
Blue Star?[BRK]

The one impudent enough to
test his mettle against my
superior power?[BRK]

[POR02]
Who...who are you? Show
yourself![BRK]

[POR00]
Ha ha ha ha ha! Cool your
temper, tiny.[BRK]

You will be shown the face
of your tormentor soon
enough.[BRK]

For now, all you need know
is that I am the Star
Dragon.[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR00]
This tower is the only link
between the Blue Star and
this world.[BRK]

There are yet many years
left to pass before the Blue
Star can awaken again.[BRK]

Until that time, I will let
no one use this tower to
travel there.[BRK]

Do you understand?[END]

=== 15 | 1dfbc | 2f ===
[0x5]But I must get to Lucia!
You must let me pass![END]

=== 16 | 1dffa | 1b1 ===
[POR01]
Don't you understand? I must
find a way to get back to
Lucia! She needs me![BRK]

[POR00]
What could she possibly need
from a human?[BRK]

[POR01]
She's alone. Alone on a
world I know nothing about.[BRK]

I know that if I were there,
I could find a way to help
her revive the Blue Star![BRK]

And then, some day in the
future, our two worlds will
come together again![BRK]

But to make any of this a
reality, I have to go there
and find Lucia![BRK]

Sir, you must let me pass![END]

=== 17 | 1e1ba | 1d1 ===
[POR01]
You must let me pass! I
will get to the Blue Star
and Lucia at any cost![BRK]

[POR00]
Why do you think you can
help her, human?[BRK]

She needs no help reviving
the Blue Star. It is her
assigned task.[BRK]

[POR01]
But that is why I must go.
Her task is my task. We are
as one...[BRK]

...but I guess you wouldn't
understand that...[BRK]

Suffice to say that I must
go to her.[BRK]

Working together, I'm sure
we will revive the Blue
Star,[BRK]

and some day, maybe our two
worlds will finally be
united again...
[END]

=== 18 | 1e38e | 4d ===
Then show me the strength
of your resolve, young
human![BRK]

We fight for passage![END]

=== 19 | 1e3e4 | 1b3 ===
You've won the right to use
the transport to the Blue
Star.[BRK]

The strength of your resolve
is admirable, young human.[BRK]

I hope that it is enough to
overcome the cold, bleak
landscape of the Blue Star.[BRK]

This is but the first step
on a long road you have
yet to travel.[BRK]

Find the hope that lies
buried among the stars,
young human.[BRK]

Go now! The way is open to
you.[BRK]

I will wait here, believing
that you have the power to
make dreams a reality...[END]

[POR02]
Look! Hiro...the Star
Dragon Crystal![BRK]

The way to the Blue Star is
before us![BRK]

...i...guess this is where
we have to say good-bye,
isn't it?
[END]

=== 1c | 1eeda | 138 ===
[POR02]
Promise me you'll...come
back in one piece, Hiro![BRK]

And tell Lucia that I...said
she better take good care of
you...or...or else...I'll...[BRK]

Ooohhhh, Hiro...
good-bye![BRK]

[POR01]
Oh, Ruby! I know I'm going
to miss you most of all![BRK]

Know that if there is a
way to come back to see
you, I'll find it![BRK]

Take care of yourself!
[END]

=== 1d | 1f03a | 18d ===
[POR05]
Well, chief, this is it, I
guess...the moment of
truth.[BRK]

I sure hope this gizmo gets
you where you're goin'![BRK]

If not, this is gonna be the
most expensive gamble of
your short career![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

But hey! It's gonna work,
so don't worry.[BRK]

Besides, you've got someone
pullin' for you upstairs, I
just know it.[BRK]

We'd better cut the gab.
Lucia's waiting.[BRK]

Go get her, tiger![BRK]

[POR01]
Uh...thanks, Ronfar.





[END]

=== 1e | 1f1ee | 130 ===
[POR10]
Hiro, are you certain you
want to try this alone?[BRK]

I mean...I could go with
...wait...what am I saying?[BRK]

This is probably something
you want to do by yourself.[BRK]

Well, good luck, godspeed,
and remember...[BRK]

If you get in trouble...you
can always dance your way
out like I taught you![BRK]

[POR01]
Hehe. Thanks, Jean.
[END]

=== 1f | 1f346 | 106 ===
[POR07]
Hiro, I wish you could stay
and join the Magic Guild,[BRK]

but I know you have to
follow your heart and your
dream.[BRK]

I hope Lucia knows what a
find she has in you. You're
worth your weight in Silver![BRK]

Take care, Hiro. [BRK]

[POR01]
Oh, Lemina...thanks. That
means a lot to me.[END]

=== 20 | 1f474 | fe ===
[POR09]
While you're on the Blue
Star, we've got our work
cut out for us here.[BRK]

One day, we will get back
to the true teachings of
Althena.[BRK]

And when that day dawns,
lasting peace will finally
be ours.[BRK]

I hope you come back to
see it.[BRK]

[POR01]
I will, Leo. I promise.

Hiro! Are you going to leave
without even saying good-bye
to your friends?[END]
