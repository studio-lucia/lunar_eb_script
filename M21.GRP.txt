Never![BRK]

You stole my innocence and
trained me in the ways of
death! I'll never forgive...[BRK]

And now, your trade in
stolen children continues![BRK]

You make me sick! You're
using the knowledge of
karate for evil![BRK]

I'll have no part of it!
And i'll take those kids,
thank you![BRK]

[POR21]
Ha ha ha ha! Oh, jean! You
always did overestimate your
abilities.[BRK]

Do you think you actually
have a chance of saving
these children?[BRK]

These kids will be free only
when my elite guards feel
death's embrace...[BRK]

And that's not too likely. I
trained them myself...[BRK]

...hahaha!

Hrmph! You fared better than
i had hoped. It seems I
trained you all too well...[BRK]

But you'll never lay a
finger on the master![BRK]

[POR10]
I'll never know until I
try![BRK]

Haaay----yaaaaaaa!!!![END]

Urmph! Ahhh!...my...mask!

Why are you running from
your weak student, master?[BRK]

Come back and fight![BRK]

[ROR00]
Ha ha ha! If you really
believe you have a chance
against me...[BRK]

Come to the town called
horam and gain entrance to
the tournament of death.[BRK]

That is the most suitable
forum for your humiliating
defeat, child.[BRK]

Soon, all will know the
strength of blue dragon
karate.[BRK]

I'm looking forward to
our...reunion...hahahaha!

This mask...

[0xB][0][0x3]Took the mysterious mask.[BRK]

[0xB][0][0][POR10]
Hmmmm...that voice...it
sounded so...familiar...[BRK]

Well...maybe if i take this
mask to master lunn, i can
gain his trust...[BRK]

Once he trusts me, he might
be able to help us![BRK]

...i'd better go see him
right away![END]

Thank you! Thank you! Thank
you![BRK]

If you hadn't saved us from
that strange man, we might
have been killed![BRK]

We have to get back to
taben's peak in a hurry![BRK]

Our leader will be
worried![BRK]

See you later![BRK]

[POR02]
Wait! We want to see your
leader, too![END]

=== b | 18ebc | aa ===
[POR02]
Shoot!
They're gone![BRK]

Why are children always
running off so fast these
days![BRK]

Anyway, we should head back
and follow them to taben's
peak.[BRK]

C'mon, hiro, let's go!
