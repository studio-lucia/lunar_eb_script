In the days before Ghaleon,
Vane used to float high
above the land.[BRK]

The only entrance was by
means of this magic
fountain of transfer.[BRK]

Fortunately, it still works!
We can use it as our own
private backdoor into Vane![BRK]

I, Lemina, Junior Premier
of the Magic Guild of Vane,
daughter of Miria, [BRK]

call upon the power of
old to manifest itself
before me!

Ha! Mega-magical! It
actually worked![BRK]

This is the first
opportunity I've had
to try that![END]

Ah! Lemina! I'm so glad
you've come to visit![BRK]

What? The transport
fountain? Hmmm....[BRK]

It has been dormant for
many years. I doubt it
even works anymore...[END]

The transport spring can
lead you to Vane,[BRK]

but it will first take you
to the Cave of Trial.[BRK]

If your magic skills are
weak, don't even try it![END]

You know, my grandfather
once told me a riddle I
have yet to solve.[BRK]

Perhaps you can help me...[BRK]

Just how many licks does it
take to get to the center of
a tootsie roll tootsie pop?[END]
