Oh no! Lucia is...[BRK]

[POR05]
Leo is trained in the ways
of Althena's Guard.[BRK]

If we don't get Lucia back
right now, there's no
telling what could happen.[BRK]

...except that it won't be
good for Lucia's health.[BRK]

So, chief, the gameplan's to
sneak onto the Destiny and
rescue her, right?





[END]

=== 1 | 969c | 68 ===
[POR02]
...what?!
Hiro, the statue of Goddess
Althena is broken!![BRK]

Now how are we going to
restore our health?[END]

=== 2 | 971c | 86 ===
[POR02]
What is this world coming to
when holy statues are
defaced like this?!![BRK]

Punk kids...they don't know
the meaning of respect
anymore.[END]

=== 3 | 97b2 | 4f ===
Welcome to Dalton![BRK]

Ships from all over the
world come to this very
famous port.[END]

=== 4 | 9814 | 69 ===
Welcome to the famous port
town of Dalton![BRK]

Are you just travelers, or
are you members of Althena's
Guard?[END]

=== 5 | 9890 | 44 ===
Dalton is the largest port
bordering on the Salyan
Desert, you know.[END]

=== 6 | 98e4 | 4f ===
Welcome to the port of
Dalton![BRK]

Now that the world is safe,
we're partying down![END]

=== 7 | 9942 | ae ===
I can't imagine what kind
of deviant would have the
gall to do this![BRK]

Now how will weary travelers
refresh their spirits?
[0x5]I was just wondering that.
Who gives a rip? I don't.[END]

=== 8 | 9a00 | 7e ===
Well, there is a statue just
like it in the shrine of the
Althena Cult.[BRK]

It's kinda weird in there,
but their statue does work.[END]

=== 9 | 9a90 | 91 ===
This is exactly the kind of
apathetic reaction that I'm
talking about![BRK]

Is nothing sacred to you
anymore? Does your life have
no meaning?[BRK]

Heretic![END]

=== a | 9b34 | ae ===
The Cult of Althena has said
they will fix the statue,
free of charge.[BRK]

I think they're a little
extreme, but I appreciate
their offer.[BRK]

I think I'll let them do
the work, too.[END]

=== b | 9bfa | 51 ===
Althena must be pleased. I
know I'm just tickled pink
now that everything's okay![END]

=== c | 9c5e | 95 ===
Northeast of here, there's 
somethin' they call the
ninth wonder of the world.[BRK]

It's some sorta dragon tower
thingamabob. They say it's
mighty keen...[END]

=== d | 9d06 | eb ===
There's a weird tower north-
east of here named after
some Star Dragon.[BRK]

Place is s'posed to be full
of mysterious stuff no one
ain't seen in a century![BRK]

Coupla young whippersnappers
like you could have a field-
day explorin' that place.[END]

=== e | 9e04 | c5 ===
Say, kiddies, didn't ya get
my hint about the Star
Tower?[BRK]

It's loaded with all sorts
uh weird monsters an' great
treasure.[BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro, I bet that's the tower
Grandpa was talking about!
Let's go!





[END]

=== f | 9edc | 81 ===
There's s'posed to be some
fancy-schmancy Star Tower
northeast of here.[BRK]

I done never been there, but
I heard it's mighty unusual.[END]

=== 10 | 9f70 | 6a ===
Hey!...hey! Do ya know
the names of the Four
Heroes of Althena?
[0x5]Yep! Saw the movie.
No, tell me about it![END]

=== 11 | 9fea | 22 ===
Movie? Say, mister, what's
that?

[END]

=== 12 | a01e | 3d ===
Oh, goodie! I hoped you'd
say that! I love reciting
them!



[END]

=== 13 | a05e | 155 ===
The first of the four heroes
is White Knight Leo, lord
of Althena's Guard.[BRK]

Second is Saint Lunn, master
of Blue Dragon Karate.[BRK]

Third is Grand Black Wizard
Borgan.[BRK]

And last is...is...hmm...[BRK]

...oh yeah! The last hero is
Red Priest Mauri.[BRK]

I learned all about them at
the school of the Althena
Cult.[BRK]

Memorized them myself.
Aren'cha proud of me?
[END]

=== 14 | a1ca | 75 ===
Hey there, have you heard
the names of the Four
Heroes of Althena?
[0x5]You told me, ya dumb kid!
Uh, I don't remember...[END]

=== 15 | a24e | 8b ===
Oh...yeah, I told you about
them already, didn't i? I
spaced and forgot...[BRK]

You probably think I'm the
world's youngest alzheimer's
patient.[END]

=== 16 | a2ea | 59 ===
Wait a minute...you look
very familiar. Hey! I
already told you this![BRK]

Oh well, listen up![END]

=== 17 | a35a | 1fe ===
My daddy said that he heard
the Four Heroes of Althena
don't control the dragons.[BRK]

He said they lost control
when the dragons were
released.[BRK]

I wish I could see one of
the dragons. They must be
awesome![BRK]

[POR02]
Well, kiddo, this is your
lucky day! Feast your eyes
on me![BRK]

[POR00]
Is this some kind of a sick
joke? You're not one of the
Four Dragons![BRK]

You're just some stinkin'...
stinkin'...well, I don't
know what you are...[BRK]

But you're too small to be
a dragon.[BRK]

[POR02]
Well, I'm big enough to
toast your impudent butt,
junior!
[END]

=== 18 | a570 | 99 ===
It would be so cool if I
got to see one of the Four
Dragons![BRK]

My dad would never believe
me, though.[BRK]

'Specially if I told him I
saw it on mulberry street.[END]

=== 19 | a620 | 95 ===
[POR05]
When we leave Dalton, we'd
better head north, toward
Illusion Woods.[BRK]

After we clear the woods, we
can make tracks for the holy
city of Pentagulia.[END]

=== 1a | a6c4 | c6 ===
One of the Four Heroes of
Althena is White Knight Leo.[BRK]

Have you seen him? He's just
so cute. I could eat him
alive![BRK]

Ooh! And that horn! Oh baby,
I bet he knows exactly how
to use that monster! Whoo![END]

=== 1b | a79e | 87 ===
Lord Leo was just here! Did
you get to see him?[BRK]

He had on the complete hunk
duds. Tight white pants and
a cool red cape.[BRK]

I'm in heaven![END]

=== 1c | a838 | 6f ===
Lord Leo left way too soon
for my taste. He had to go
fight monsters or something.[BRK]

I hope he comes back soon...[END]

=== 1d | a8ba | 78 ===
There's a rumor floating
around that Lord Leo's been
thrown out of the guard![BRK]

How can that be?[BRK]

Do you know if it's true?[END]

=== 1e | a942 | b0 ===
When Leo found out that the
Althena Cult was trying to
revive Zophar, he left.[BRK]

Good looks and principled,
too! Is this guy too good to
be true or what?!![BRK]

Come to mama, big boy![END]

=== 1f | aa00 | e2 ===
[POR09]
While I'd like to honor your
request, I'm afraid you may
not let me go.[BRK]

So, I must respectfully deny
your request and just blow
you a kiss from here.[BRK]

Be sure to catch my 'lords
of valor' beefcake calendar
when it comes out.[END]

=== 20 | aaf2 | b2 ===
Have you heard of the Cult
of Althena? They have a
shrine up there.[BRK]

They're saying that the
Goddess has come back to
save the world.[BRK]

But I really don't see how
that can be true.
[END]

=== 21 | abb8 | b1 ===
Did you see how immense the
Dragonship Destiny was?![BRK]

The power of Althena is
truly a wonderful thing,[BRK]

but I don't know about her
followers. They're a little
weird for my taste.
[END]

=== 22 | ac7c | af ===
The members of Althena's
Cult keep inviting me to go
to their shrine.[BRK]

I've been turning them down,
but maybe now it wouldn't be
a bad idea.[BRK]

I could pray to Althena for
help...[END]

=== 23 | ad3a | 7e ===
You know what those cult
members were doing?[BRK]

Those evil little weasels
were praying for the return
of Zophar![BRK]

Isn't that sick?[END]

=== 24 | adc8 | 95 ===
When I grow up, I want to
be a strong man that can
protect our world.[BRK]

I really look up to the Four
Heroes of Althena. They're
sorta my role models...[END]

=== 25 | ae70 | 79 ===
When I grow up, I want to
be a member of Althena's
Guard.[BRK]

Lord Leo is so cool! He must
be the greatest guy to work
under![END]

=== 26 | aefc | cf ===
Lately, I've been having
nightmares where numbers
keep attacking me.[BRK]

I keep seeing the number
52,766...and it scares me.
What does it mean?[BRK]

Please, ya gotta tell me!
I'm afraid to even shut my
eyes at night![END]

=== 27 | afda | 89 ===
I heard that because people
all worked together, our
world was saved.[BRK]

When I grow up, I want to
be able to save the world
from evil, too![END]

=== 28 | b072 | 66 ===
Work, eat, sleep. Work, eat
sleep. That's all I ever
seem to do anymore.[BRK]

I tell ya, it's a dog's
life![END]

=== 29 | b0ec | 86 ===
I heard Lord Leo captured a
destroyer! Can you believe
that?[BRK]

A destroyer, right here in
our little town! What is
this world comin' to?[END]

=== 2a | b186 | 117 ===
I tell ya, those cult
members are really gettin'
on my nerves.[BRK]

Yesterday, they had the gall
to ask me if I'd donate my
paycheck to Althena![BRK]

Can you believe that? I
mean, a donation's one
thing, but my whole check?!![BRK]

Those little weasels are
gettin' too greedy for their
own good.[END]

=== 2b | b2ac | 85 ===
I tell ya. Each day that
goes by,[BRK]

I'm doubtin' more that
Althena is supportin' the
Cult.[BRK]

I think it's just a big scam
to get money...[END]

=== 2c | b336 | 6 ===
Dalton[END]

=== 2d | c7e4 | d ===
Donated 100s![END]

=== 2e | c81a | 91 ===
If you donate to the Goddess
Althena, all your strength
will be renewed.[BRK]

Try it, won't you? It's so
easy. Just walk up to the
statue and do it...[END]

=== 2f | c8ba | 4e ===
If you kneel in front of the
statue and donate, your
strength will be renewed.[END]

=== 30 | c91c | c9 ===
Because the statue at the
town entrance is broken,
the townspeople come here.[BRK]

I do not know who broke the
statue, but it was good for
our shrine.[BRK]

Donations are up 1000% over
last month. It's wonderful![END]

=== 31 | c9fc | 96 ===
I wonder if one of the Cult
members broke the statue to
bring the townspeople here.[BRK]

While I don't condone the
method, the result is
certainly welcome![END]

=== 32 | caa6 | a7 ===
We have volunteered to fix
the statue to stop rumors
that we broke it.[BRK]

But we never said exactly
when we'd fix it.[BRK]

I think it'll stay broken
a while longer...ha ha ha![END]

=== 33 | cb5c | 87 ===
The holy city of Pentagulia
is off-limits to outsiders.[BRK]

Supposedly, a terrible evil
has been sealed there that
could destroy our world.[END]

=== 34 | cbf2 | 9f ===
I just heard that Pentagulia
was reduced to rubble![BRK]

And they say that Zophar
tried to seize Althena's
power![BRK]

Are these rumors true?! Did
that really happen??!
[END]

=== 35 | cca0 | 72 ===
This is my annual hobble-a-
thon for Althena.[BRK]

Can I put you down for 10s
a lap? It's for the Goddess,
you know....[END]

=== 36 | cd24 | 40 ===
[POR02]
You don't look like you're
hobbling to me! Forget it,
buster![END]

=== 37 | cd74 | ba ===
The mistakes we made in the
past should be freely
admitted.[BRK]

We were misled by the fake
Althena. Please forgive us.[BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro, I think he's serious!
Maybe some of the Cult
members are good![END]

=== 38 | ce42 | 6e ===
The Goddess Althena comes
to our world in human form
to save it from destruction.[BRK]

They say she has come again.[END]

=== 39 | cec8 | 47 ===
If the Goddess has returned,
Lord Leo has direct contact
with her.




[END]

=== 3a | cf1e | 90 ===
The Goddess Althena was an
impostor! I wonder if the
four heroes are too?![BRK]

Now that this has come to
light, I'm beginning to
doubt everything...[END]

=== 3b | cfbe | 85 ===
Only the Goddess Althena
can save our world from
destruction.[BRK]

But she needs all your
donations to make this
possible. Give freely...
[END]

=== 3c | d050 | 74 ===
[POR08]
But....what...will Althena
do with the money? Isn't she
a goddess?[BRK]

She has no use for the money
of your world...
[END]

=== 3d | d0d2 | 7e ===
[POR07]
Silly! The goddess obviously
has to have money for her
organization to run![BRK]

People don't work for free
these days, ya know![END]

=== 3e | d164 | 36 ===
It's amazing to me that our
world was saved by humans.[END]

=== 3f | d1aa | 7e ===
Perhaps we have misread the
teachings of Althena.[BRK]

If it is possible for humans
to save our world, anything
becomes possible...[END]

=== 40 | d238 | 8a ===
The fine people of this town
are finally comprehending
the teachings of Althena.[BRK]

I wish the villagers of
Larpa would follow their 
lead...[END]

=== 41 | d2d6 | 78 ===
We are grateful to Althena
that her servant Leo caught
the destroyer.[BRK]

If he had not, our world
would be in great danger.[END]

=== 42 | d362 | cc ===
Compared with the residents
of Dalton, the people of
Larpa are dullards.[BRK]

Their skulls are so thick,
no teachings of light can
get through.[BRK]

...and they're cheap, too.
Won't donate a dime to help
our cause.[END]

=== 43 | d43e | 119 ===
We have seen the error of
our ways and are trying to
rediscover the real Althena.[BRK]

We want to understand her
real teachings and tell them
to the people.[BRK]

But you're not gonna get
some tearful, fake 'I have
sinned' speech.[BRK]

We're just gonna try really
hard to make things right
again.
[END]

=== 44 | d566 | ec ===
Whew! She's a looker, ain't
she?[BRK]

I mean, this is just a
statue, but man! It's so
lifelike...[BRK]

I could stare at that form
all day long and never get
tired of it![BRK]

I hate to say it, but that
statue has got me enter-
taining impure thoughts![END]

=== 45 | d662 | 99 ===
I've heard that the real
Althena no longer exists.[BRK]

I tell you, man, it's a
total shame that a bod like
that died out.[BRK]

That Alex dude was one
lucky guy...[END]

Dalton shrine[END]

=== 47 | e558 | 83 ===
Ahhh! Nothin' like a tall
cold one to knock the edge
off a long workday.[BRK]

Lord Leo's given us shore-
leave since we found that
girl.[END]

=== 48 | e5ee | dc ===
Tomorrow, Lord Leo is going
to execute the girl we
captured.[BRK]

She's so cute, though. I
have a hard time buying the
fact she's a destroyer.[BRK]

I dunno. I'm just glad I'm
not Leo. But I guess he's
got his orders from Althena.
[END]

=== 49 | e6de | 2c ===
Oh man! I think that ale
just hit me! Whooo![END]

=== 4a | e71e | ab ===
Say, I must be more wasted
than I thought, 'cause you
look like that girl Lucia...[BRK]

...but I know she's in the
jail on the Destiny.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

This is some good stuff,
man![END]

=== 4b | e7dc | 69 ===
I'm sure glad Lord Leo saw
fit to finally give us a
break.[BRK]

I mean, we've been working
for weeks straight![END]

=== 4c | e858 | b4 ===
I really don't think Leo is
going to execute that girl.[BRK]

Orders or not, I just don't
think he's got the balls to
do it. She's innocent.[BRK]

If that girl's a destroyer,
I'm june cleaver.[END]

=== 4d | e920 | 69 ===
Have you tried the ale here?
The stuff's top-notch, and
cheap, too![BRK]

I'm glad we found this
little dive...[END]

=== 4e | e99c | a4 ===
I respect Lord Leo more than
almost anyone else.[BRK]

In my experience, he's
always been fair.[BRK]

That's why I don't think
he'll kill the girl until
he's absolutely sure...[END]

=== 4f | ea54 | 7c ===
Man, I'm just having a hard
time believing that the girl
we captured is a destroyer.[BRK]

I mean she looks...so...so
...innocent.[END]

Ever since we went in that
Blue Spire, I've had weird

Ya think it's post-traumatic

10S! Hiro, let's buy a ton

We can sell them in Larpa

[POR02]
You dingbat! By the time we
get to Larpa, they'll be
undrinkable! Get real![END]

=== 55 | edc2 | 6d ===
Business here is down these
days because the Cult looks
down on drinking.[BRK]

I wonder if it's the same
all over?[END]

=== 56 | ee42 | c4 ===
If it weren't for the men of
Althena's Guard, this place
would be deserted.[BRK]

I keep tellin' the owner he
should make an espresso bar
outta this place.[BRK]

He'd make a mint on steamed
milk and coffee...[END]

=== 57 | ef1a | df ===
I think I'm going to stop
coming here pretty soon if
things don't pick up.[BRK]

I mean, I'm not getting any

Good men are not easy to

I have the best odds![END]

Since the world was saved

C'mon, drink up! All the

this?[END]

I overheard the guards
saying the destroyer looks
like a cute, innocent girl![BRK]

What a clever disguise![END]

=== 5b | f15c | 120 ===
This place is deserted, but
the shrine is jumpin'![BRK]

I think a lot of people in
Dalton are joining the
shrine to find meaning.[BRK]

[POR02]
Meaning?[BRK]

[POR00]
You know, meaning in their
dead-end lives and miserable
relationships.[BRK]

...I hope they find what
they're looking for. But
I don't think they will...
[END]

I'm so glad the world is
safe from destruction![BRK]

Now I can continue working

After a hard day's work,
it's my pleasure to say
...'bottoms up!'[BRK]

Ahhh! That hit the spot!

The priests of Althena's
Cult said that even though
the girl looks innocent,[BRK]

she's a destroyer, and to be
executed immediately.[BRK]

But hey...enough depressing
talk. I'm here to toss back
a few cold ones![BRK]

Bottoms up![END]

=== 5f | f476 | a1 ===
Oh boy! The girl they say is 
a destroyer has escaped from
the Destiny![BRK]

Now we've got some sort of a
world-wrecker walking among

...oh man!...I need a drink![END]

If it's not one thing, it's

Now the priests of the Cult

Lord Leo is a wonderful
leader and an honorable man.[BRK]

If I were ten years younger,
I'd enlist to serve under
him in a heartbeat![END]

Althena's guard is keeping
our world from anarchy.[BRK]

But I think it would fall
apart were it not for Lord
Leo.
[END]

=== 6b | 106ec | ca ===
Hmmm...I've heard that the
Cult of Althena was teaching
the wrong message.[BRK]

But that still doesn't
change my opinion of Lord
Leo.[BRK]

That's why I'm worried that
since the Zophar ordeal,
he's been missing...[END]

=== 6c | 107ca | 45 ===
Whew! Leo! When you
disappeared, I was worried
you wouldn't be found.[END]

All of my friends have
joined the Cult of Althena.[BRK]

I was thinking I should also
join so I won't be lonely.[END]

Ha! Now all my friends are
out of the Cult since
Althena is gone.[BRK]

I'm glad I didn't join the

Okay, your loss...[END]

Lord Leo is the captain of
the Dragonship Destiny.[BRK]

He's kind to his friends and
relentless with his enemies.[BRK]

I'm glad I'm not on his bad
side...[END]

I think the Goddess Althena
is absolutely beautiful![BRK]

I would like to meet her in
person someday.[END]

=== 77 | 11376 | 95 ===
You mean to tell me that the
Goddess the Althena Cult was
serving was a fake?[BRK]

Great! Just great! Now I'll
never get to meet the real
Goddess Althena.[END]

=== 78 | 1141a | 73 ===
After listening to the
priests of the shrine talk,[BRK]

I'm convinced that the
Goddess really has returned
to our world.[END]

The Dragonship Destiny is
one fine piece of work.[BRK]

It can be maneuvered on both
land and sea![END]

Leo is single-minded, kind,
and strong-willed.[BRK]

I admire the qualities that
man possesses. I wish I was
more like him.[END]

=== 7b | 11598 | 67 ===
I always looked up to Lord
Leo,[BRK]

but now that he's not in
Althena's Guard anymore,
I wonder about him...[END]

=== 7c | 1160e | 90 ===
I feel like a fool for
believing those charlatans
at the shrine.[BRK]

And to think that I actually
gave them money while they
tried to revive Zophar![END]

I've asked the priests of
the shrine to fix the statue
of Goddess Althena,[BRK]

but they never get it fixed.
I think they want to see it
stay broken.[END]

=== 81 | 13126 | 7e ===
Is the girl that Lord Leo
captured really a destroyer?[BRK]

I hope he isn't making a
mistake by executing her
as Althena commanded.[END]

=== 82 | 131b8 | bc ===
I guess the statue is going
to stay broken.[BRK]

The priest won't repair it
because he wants people to
keep coming to the shrine.[BRK]

That way, his donations stay
high. It's greed, pure and
simple.[END]

=== 83 | 13284 | 83 ===
Now that the truth about
Althena has come out, I feel
much better.[BRK]

I always suspected something
fishy about that Cult of
Althena...[END]

The passage to the right
leads to the pier.[BRK]

But no boats are docked
there right now, so the door
is locked.[END]

=== 88 | 1444a | 96 ===
The doorway to the right
leads to the Dalton Pier.[BRK]

The Dragonship Destiny is
currently docked there.[BRK]

You should go see it. The
ship's just incredible![END]

=== 89 | 14504 | 58 ===
Have you seen the dragon-
ship destiny?[BRK]

That is the most incredible
ship I've ever seen![END]

=== 8a | 1456c | 6a ===
I heard that the Dragonship
Destiny was in the area.[BRK]

It would be such an honor
if they docked in our port![END]

=== 8b | 145ea | c8 ===
Hmmm....Pentagulia. Yes, you
can get there by way of this
port.[BRK]

But since only members of
Althena's Guard and the
Priesthood can enter,[BRK]

why would you want to go
there? You'll never be able
to get in!
[END]

=== 8c | 146c6 | 88 ===
I heard that you were going
to try to get into Penta-

You know, that place is
rumored to be guarding the
essence of evil itself!

[POR02]
Essence of evil? You think
he's talking about Zophar?[END]

=== 8e | 147a6 | c6 ===
[POR08]
Then it is possible that
Althena may also be in
Pentagulia...[BRK]

[POR05]
I knew that something
powerful was sealed in
Pentagulia,[BRK]

but I never would have
guessed it was Zophar! Holy
cow! If that's true...[END]

=== 8f | 14884 | 94 ===
Rumors floating about speak
of evil sealed within the
walls of Pentagulia.[BRK]

[POR02]
That's not true! The only
thing sealed within Penta-
gulia is Althena![END]

=== 90 | 14928 | 76 ===
We heard news here that some
incredible heroes destroyed
Pentagulia![BRK]

Was it necessary to destroy
it to save our world?[END]

=== 91 | 149ac | 73 ===
[POR05]
The choice was destroy
Pentagulia, or be torched to
cinders by Zophar.[BRK]

I think we made the right
choice, mister.[END]

He used to be a priest,

Priests of Althena's Cult
say that they'll fix our

Unfortunately, most of the

Those soldiers of Althena's
Guard are making too much
noise![BRK]

Now I can't get a decent
night's sleep around here![BRK]

And since the statue's
broken,[BRK]

I can't even use it to make
up for the lack of sleep![BRK]

I hope the priests of the
Cult come through and fix
it soon.[BRK]

They promised to a while
back...[END]

=== 96 | 153dc | d2 ===
Trying to sleep around here
is doing me no good at all.[BRK]

I'm so desperate, I'm
thinking of donating to use
the statue in the shrine![BRK]

I hate to give money to
those money-grubbing cult
members,[BRK]

but I need my rest![END]

=== 97 | 154be | b8 ===
You know, I've heard that
some of the priests are real
lookers![BRK]

Maybe it's not such a bad
idea to use the statue of
Althena in the shrine.[BRK]

I can do some hunk-hunting
while I'm there...[END]
