Look! Look, Hiro! Over there!
It's some sort of strange
runes or something...[BRK]

[POR08]
This is some sort of magic
historical record...[BRK]

It seems to be hundreds of
years old. Let me try to
activate it...[END]

=== 1 | 1487e | 148 ===
[POR10]
I've never seen anything
like that![BRK]

[POR05]
Whoo! That was one serious
assault on the senses! What
the hell was it?[BRK]

[POR07]
I think it was showing the
time when...Vane was
destroyed.[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, Hiro? I'm kinda gettin'
the creeps...How 'bout we
get outta here?[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR08]
...His former self...
Althena...What does this
record mean?


[END]

=== 2 | 149d0 | 268 ===
[POR07]
Ghaleon???[BRK]

In the distant past, there
was a person named 'Magic
Emperor Ghaleon...'[BRK]

He seized Althena's power
and tried to destroy the
world.[BRK]

If this is the same person,
we're all in big trouble.[BRK]

[POR10]
Oh, Lemina! That was
centuries ago![BRK]

[POR02]
And besides, wasn't the
Magic Emperor destroyed by
Dragonmaster Alex?[BRK]

That's what Grandpa Gwyn's
history book said...[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR05]
That dude creeped the crud
in my toe jams! Whoa![BRK]

I mean...he seethed evil,
you know? There's no way
that he's human...[BRK]

His magic's simply too
strange, too strong![BRK]

[POR08]
His...appearance makes me
uneasy, but there's some-
thing in his...eyes...[END]

Mystic Ruins 6F[END]

=== 4 | 1562a | e2 ===
You are the first visitors
to come since dear, sweet
Ghaleon arrived.[BRK]

He made this place into a
beautiful, lush garden. We
think he's great.[BRK]

What do you think of Master
Ghaleon?
[0x5]He gives me the creeps!
He seems nice enough...[END]

=== 5 | 1571c | 7b ===
That's only because you
don't know him well enough.[BRK]

He's really just a poor,
lost little boy in big, evil
guy's clothing...[END]

=== 6 | 157a8 | 3a ===
Ahh! You have the insight to
the person inside, don't
you?[END]

=== 7 | 157fa | 51 ===
Welcome to Ghaleon's secret
garden. He seems quite fond
of this place he created.[END]

=== 8 | 1585e | 7b ===
Are you going up into the
Mystic Ruins?[BRK]

Funny, another person just
went in ahead of you. If you
hurry, you might catch him![END]

=== 9 | 158e8 | 32 ===
Oh, I see now! All of you
are friends, aren't you?[END]

=== a | 1592e | 81 ===
The door to the south is the
exit of this garden.[BRK]

But you must know how to
open the magic lock, and
only Ghaleon knows the word.
[END]

=== b | 159c6 | fa ===
Ghaleon cast difficult spell
combinations in different
areas of these ruins.[BRK]

He wanted to make it hard
for people to penetrate his
sanctuary.[BRK]

In fact, you should see the
incredible spell that guards
his ABBA memoribilia...[BRK]

[POR08]
Hmm...I...I wonder if...[END]

=== c | 15ad8 | cf ===
Ghaleon shuns nearly all
human contact. He's a very
private person...[BRK]

But he has entrusted me
with the task of re-sorting
his entire ABBA collection![BRK]

He seems to really like
them, though I don't know
why...
[END]

=== d | 15bba | 1db ===
Dear, sweet Ghaleon has not
been here for many months.[BRK]

I wonder why he neglects the
beautiful garden he created?[BRK]

I even finished the task he
assigned me...[BRK]

Now, his ABBA records lie
silently in alphabetical
order,[BRK]

waiting for his appreciative
ear...[BRK]

[POR02]
Since you don't have Ghaleon
around here any more, I'll
ask Nall to guard you!![BRK]

He'll probably have the Blue
and Black Dragons look out
for you, too![BRK]

If you're lucky, maybe
they'll torch the LP's, too![BRK]

So cheer up, okay?!![END]

=== e | 15dac | 6c ===
You are too kind. I
appreciate your love and
concern.[BRK]

Hopefully, Master Ghaleon
will return to us someday...[END]

=== f | 15e2c | 52 ===
[POR08]
I believe I can detect and
remove the spell binding
this door.[BRK]

Just a moment...[END]

=== 10 | 15e88 | d1 ===
[POR08]
Ghaleon seems to be a little
extreme in his security.[BRK]

The only people that could
break that spell are
Althena, Ghaleon, and me.[BRK]

...Curious that he would use
such strong measures for
this ancient ruin...



[END]

=== 11 | 15f74 | 7f ===
Master Ghaleon possesses a
wondrous magic power. How
powerful is it?[BRK]

Well, legend has it that
Althena herself once bowed
to it.[END]

=== 12 | 16000 | 4a ===
[POR08]
You mean to say that Ghaleon
defeated Althena?!![BRK]

That cannot be true...[END]

=== 13 | 16066 | b8 ===
Long, long ago, dear Ghaleon
strived hard to rule the
whole world.[BRK]

But his plans were foiled
by a Dragonmaster named
Alex.[BRK]

Ghaleon himself told us
that. He seemed very sad
about it...
[END]

=== 14 | 1613a | 97 ===
I don't like seeing Ghaleon
with a sad face, but that's
all he's had lately...[BRK]

I was thinking about sending
him a Teleflora bouquet.
What do you think?[END]

=== 15 | 161e0 | 86 ===
You came from outside the
ruins! Have you seen dear
Ghaleon anywhere?[BRK]

He hasn't been here for oh
so long, and we're starting
to worry.[END]

=== 16 | 1627a | a2 ===
Zzzzz....
....zzzzz..
.......zzzzzz...[BRK]

[POR02]
Ohhh, how adorable. She's
sleeping while flying![BRK]

Why don't we put her hand
in warm water and see what
else she can do?

[END]

=== 17 | 16334 | 33 ===
G...Ghaleon....zzzz....
...Come...Come back...zzz..[END]

=== 18 | 16376 | 81 ===
I was dreaming that I was
controlled by a river filled
with 1's and 0's...[BRK]

....It made no sense to me.
Do you know what it means?[END]

=== 19 | 1640e | 60 ===
There's something quite
strange about the girl
there...[BRK]

She's not a human, is she?[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[END]

=== 1a | 1648a | 58 ===
You're not human, but you're
not like Ghaleon, either.[BRK]

Where are you from, strange
girl?[END]

=== 1b | 164f6 | 3a ===
What happened to the
mysterious girl? I kind of
liked her.[END]

=== 1c | 16540 | 6d ===
So, the strange girl that
was with you disappeared
like Master Ghaleon...[BRK]

How heart-breaking...[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[END]

=== 1d | 165c0 | 62 ===
I heard the strangest rumor![BRK]

They say that dear Ghaleon
was revived from the dead!
Can it be true?[END]

=== 1e | 16630 | 38 ===
[POR07]
You mean to say that he's
some kind of undead zombie?[END]

=== 1f | 16680 | 7a ===
Long, long ago, Ghaleon was
the Magic Emperor and sought
to rule the world.[BRK]

In the process, he blew Vane
from the skies...[END]

=== 20 | 16708 | a3 ===
[POR07]
If he is the same Ghaleon
that destroyed Vane once,
I'll wring his neck![BRK]

There is no excuse for what
he did! None! Nada! Zippo![BRK]

Oouughh! Now I'm really
steamed![END]

=== 21 | 167c6 | 5b ===
I don't understand how, but
Ghaleon was restored from
death.[BRK]

It's true! He said it
himself![END]

=== 22 | 1682e | be ===
[POR07]
Zophar must be behind
Ghaleon's return from the
dead![BRK]

It goes against all the laws
of nature, so I know it
can't be Althena's doing...[BRK]

Besides, why would she want
to do a thing like that?[END]

=== 23 | 16908 | 5e ===
When Ghaleon was the Magic
Emperor, he used his power
to destroy Vane.[BRK]

He must be very strong.[END]

=== 24 | 16974 | df ===
[POR07]
Ouugh! Just thinking about
that makes me mad![BRK]

I'm gonna make that Ghaleon
contribute to restore Vane!
.........Bet on it![BRK]

[POR02]
And how do you plan on
doing that?[BRK]

It's not like he's just
gonna write you a check,
you idiot!
[END]

=== 25 | 16a66 | a9 ===
Ghaleon was resurrected by
the power of Zophar.[BRK]

Therefore, he could neither
seal nor destroy Zophar by
himself.[BRK]

I heard him talking about it
the last time he was here...[END]

=== 26 | 16b1e | ae ===
Ghaleon said that this world
will be destroyed soon.[BRK]

That's why he made this
secret garden and let us
stay here.[BRK]

He said we'd be safe here
forever. But how is that
possible?
[END]

=== 27 | 16bda | 9b ===
[POR10]
If Ghaleon is supposed to be
so evil, why'd he care about
these fairies?[BRK]

[POR00]
Evil? Ghaleon is not evil!
He is our protector![BRK]

Doesn't he protect you, too?[END]

=== 28 | 16c84 | ed ===
Ghaleon was worried that a
boy named Hiro might fall
in love with a girl he met.[BRK]

He said if that happened,
this world would not stand
a chance against Zophar...[BRK]

I wonder what he meant?[BRK]

[POR01]
Ghaleon said that? But I'm
sure he'd help Lucia!
[END]

=== 29 | 16d84 | 66 ===
Dear, sweet Ghaleon is one
of the nicest men I've ever
known.[BRK]

His heart is kinder than you
may know...[END]

=== 2a | 16e02 | 68 ===
Ghaleon is racked by guilt
of his former self...[BRK]

He says he will make things
right again before he dies.[END]

=== 2b | 16e7a | dc ===
Ghaleon deceived Zophar into
thinking he was on Zophar's
side.[BRK]

Ghaleon knew all along that
human power could defeat
Zophar.[BRK]

His ruse saved this world.[BRK]

Now he can stop tormenting
himself with guilt. I wonder
where he is?
