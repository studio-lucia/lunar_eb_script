I can't believe this! Pinch
me - I've gotta be dreaming![BRK]

[POR10]
I've never seen anything
like it! The whole town is
flying.[BRK]

[POR08]
Since Althena is powering
this world no longer,[BRK]

I wonder where the magic to
levitate an entire city is
coming from...?[BRK]

[POR07]
It is...It must be![BRK]

I don't believe it! It's
Neo-Vane![END]

Whoa! They captured the
Destiny![BRK]

What kind of power is it
they're using?![BRK]

[POR08]
It's definitely magic, but
what's the source?[BRK]

Could it be that they are
drawing on the power of
the Black Dragon?[BRK]

If that's the case, their
range must be limited. [END]
