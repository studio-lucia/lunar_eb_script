This is the fifth tower
of Pentagulia.[BRK]

[POR02]
But...where's the lake?
It was...???[BRK]

[POR08]
The lake was simply the
Transport Fountain...a
doorway to this place...[BRK]

We must hurry. The real
Althena must be locked
inside this tower.[END]

[POR18]
Oh, Pentagulia...What has
become of you?[BRK]

How in the name of Zophar
have Althena's Dragons
found release?[BRK]

Zophar...I must make Master
Zophar hear my plea![BRK]

Master Zophar...Master
Zophar.........!!![END]

[POR10]
Is everybody all right?[BRK]

[POR05]
Dang!...Why did Lucia
take our magic?[BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! This is a fine fix![BRK]

Now the Junior Premier of
the Vane Magic Guild doesn't
even have any magic![BRK]

Thanks a lot, Lucia![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR02]
Why did Lucia do this?[BRK]

Althena herself said that
humanity's power is the
key...[BRK]

[POR05]
...and we've got that in
spades![BRK]

[POR02]
But she's going to try to
face down Zophar on her
own...[BRK]

But what will happen when
she tries to use the power
of Althena herself???[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Oh man! This is just
getting too confusing![BRK]

Lucia! What are you doing?
What's your plan?!![END]

The Tower is sealed with
some sort of magic.[BRK]

I've never felt magic this
powerful before.[BRK]

I'm certain it's not of
human origin...[BRK]

In fact, I'm fairly certain
it is the work of Zophar...[BRK]

[POR18]
My, Lucia! You do have a
keen sense of the obvious![BRK]

Of course this is Zophar's
seal![BRK]

It was created to keep tripe
like you out![END]

[POR18]
Ahh, the Goddess Tower! It
seems to be such a pure,
tranquil place...[BRK]

And that's why the city of
Pentagulia was erected in
front of it.[BRK]

Its power and purity could
not be allowed to escape
into this world.[BRK]

Fortunately, the power of
the Four Dragons was easy to
mold to Zophar's will.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Funny. The one thing Althena
depended on most for
protection...[BRK]

was what helped create this
seal on the Goddess Tower.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Oh, and one last confession
before you...um...go.[BRK]

I must admit that I did not
create this seal for Zophar
alone.[BRK]

I had a little help from my
dear friends...[END]

[POR18]
Your miserable souls will
enable us to finally revive
our great leader...Zophar![BRK]

You know, you should look
upon it as a great hon...[BRK]

...What!? Ghaleon?[BRK]

What is wrong with you?[BRK]

I did not order you to
appear! Leave at once![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, great...just...super![BRK]

Ghaleon![BRK]

Our chances for survival
just took a dive into the
crapper![END]

=== 6 | ca0c | c1 ===
[POR08]
What...What's happening?!![BRK]

Althena...is, is...that you?[BRK]

I...I don't understand...[BRK]

[POR02]
Look, Hiro! The Dragon Wings
are beginning to glow!![BRK]

But what's causing it???[BRK]

????
?????[BRK]

...........Whoa![END]

[POR18]
...What is the meaning
of this?!![BRK]

I demand to know what is
going on this minute![BRK]

[POR00]
You are pathetic...[BRK]

[POR18]
Ghaleon!? Show yourself![END]

=== 8 | cb5a | 1db ===
[POR18]
Why did you allow Lucia to
escape?[BRK]

I will hold you personally
accountable to Zophar![BRK]

[POR14]
What a poor imitation of 
Althena you are, goddess. [BRK]

You don't even have the 
power to capture a little 
girl without my power...[BRK]

But you let parlor tricks
and tired magic ease her
through your grasp.[BRK]

They escaped with help from
one of their friends.[BRK]

But don't worry your empty
little head about it.[BRK]

I will go and retrieve the
girl and her simple-minded
associates...[BRK]

Just wait he...[END]
