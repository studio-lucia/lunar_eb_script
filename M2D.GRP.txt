[POR05]
Hmm...just as I remember it.
Nothing ever changes in this
ol' town.[BRK]

Ever since I was a kid
growing up here with Leo and
Mauri, it's been the same.[BRK]

...boring.[END]

=== 1 | 84bc | 7d ===
Didja know this here was the
village of Raculi?[BRK]

Yep! North of here ya got
the Serak Palace, and across
the sea is Pentagulia![END]

=== 2 | 8546 | 6f ===
Hey there, kiddies, you look
familiar. Have I seen you
before?[BRK]

[POR05]
Grandpa, it's me, Ronfar!
Don't you remember?[END]

=== 3 | 85cc | 65 ===
Raculi is in a perfect
location.[BRK]

North, we've got the Serak
Palace, and across the sea
is Pentagulia.[END]

=== 4 | 8642 | ba ===
Say, you look like my
grandson Ronfar! The
likeness is amazing![BRK]

[POR05]
That's because I am your
grandson, Grandpa![BRK]

Have you been taking your
medication lately? You seem
a little out of it...[END]

=== 5 | 8714 | 62 ===
Welcome to Raculi.[BRK]

We have a little trouble
every now 'n' then, but it's
usually pretty peaceful.
[END]

=== 6 | 878e | 109 ===
This is the village of...
...hey, Ronfar! What are
you doing?[BRK]

I thought you finally
decided to settle down with
Mauri?[BRK]

Does she know you're gala-
vanting around the country
with these kooks?[BRK]

[POR05]
They're not kooks, Grandpa!
And I have good reason for
being with them.[END]

=== 7 | 88a4 | e5 ===
[POR09]
If you do anything to make
Mauri cry, you'll have me
to answer to![BRK]

As your big brother-in-law,
it's my job to keep you in
line...[BRK]

[POR05]
Whoa there, partner! Hold
off on the stuff about us
being related![BRK]

You're giving me a rash...[END]

=== 8 | 89a4 | 74 ===
I knew Mauri should have
chosen a more stable man![BRK]

[POR05]
Hey! Who you calling
unstable? You're back in
diapers, gramps![END]

=== 9 | 8a26 | 5b ===
[POR09]
Okay, Ronfar, call me
brother! I want to hear it![BRK]

[POR05]
Uh...no...no...you can't
make me!

[END]

=== a | 8a9a | d2 ===
Mauri is cleansing souls at
Serak Palace.[BRK]

I've heard reports that
she's the one making people
insane.[BRK]

They say she has fire in
her eyes...[BRK]

And they're forcing us to
go to her to cleanse our
souls...I'm scared!
[END]

=== b | 8b70 | 43 ===
I'm terrified of what will
happen when they call me
to be cleansed![END]

=== c | 8bce | 71 ===
It's a miracle! The madness
that descended on us has
been lifted![BRK]

Praise be to the Goddess
Althena for her mercy![END]

=== d | 8c5a | 30 ===
Thank goodness everyone is
back to normal again![END]

=== e | 8c9e | 77 ===
The people who were taken
by madness because of Mauri
don't remember a thing.[BRK]

Actually, it's probably
better that way. [END]

=== f | 8d26 | 8f ===
[POR08]
I think the nightmare is
just beginning...[BRK]

[POR00]
What? What did you say?
I thought you said...[BRK]

[POR08]
Ah...oh, nothing...forget
I said anything...
[END]

=== 10 | 8dc8 | ad ===
Zophar is gone, and peace
has returned to our village.[BRK]

Even so, there are some who
relive the terror of Mauri's
cleansings...[BRK]

But thankfully, even that
will fade in time...
[END]

=== 11 | 8e88 | f4 ===
There is a legend that says
tears of the Goddess can
heal any condition.[BRK]

I wonder if they can cure
the madness that overtakes
those cleansed by Mauri.[BRK]

If it did work, we could
never tell Mauri what we
found out...[BRK]

She'd probably have us
killed.[END]

=== 12 | 8f94 | 96 ===
The legendary tears of
Althena are said to have
wonderful healing qualities.[BRK]

If I could get some of
those, I could heal those
that have gone insane...[END]

=== 13 | 903e | 78 ===
It's a miracle! All those
afflicted by madness have
returned to normal![BRK]

I wonder if someone used the
tears of Althena...[END]

=== 14 | 90d0 | 8f ===
I have dedicated my life to
finding ways to cure people
of disease.[BRK]

We must find ways to cure
the sick without relying
solely on goddess tears.[END]

=== 15 | 9162 | 4b ===
One day, mankind will be
able to cure any disease.
Won't that be wonderful?[END]

=== 16 | 91ca | 2f ===
Hahahahahahahahahahaha!
Ahhhh hahahahahahahaha![END]

=== 17 | 91fc | 86 ===
Beeble bobble beeble dee
thwat poppa poo poo!
Hahahahahahahahahahaa![BRK]

[POR02]
I'm thinking a large dose
of lithium might be in
order here...[END]

=== 18 | 929a | ac ===
Boom batta bomm bomm!
Wha hahahahahahahaa![BRK]

Falla whatta ping goo.
Perot is god...or is it
godot? [BRK]

Perot, godot, what's the
difference...we're still
waiting...haahahahahaah![END]

=== 19 | 935a | 97 ===
Since the initiation, I
am stuck in a vat of madness
that comes and goes...[BRK]

Please...you've got to
hel...hahahaha! Winky pinky
poopy fop! Hahahahahaha![END]

=== 1a | 9404 | c5 ===
I haven't been able to sleep
lately because of the weird
dreams I keep having.[BRK]

I think Mauri's cleansing
has somehow damaged me...[BRK]

[POR02]
I'll say...you should have
seen the way you were acting
before![END]

=== 1b | 94e0 | 7c ===
I keep having this dream
where I'm insane...it's just
so weird![BRK]

It's just sapping all my
energy by keeping me up at
night...[END]

=== 1c | 9570 | 123 ===
Oh, what am I going to do?
It's my...my husband...he's
been like this ever since...[BRK]

Oh, this is terrible! I
mean, he wasn't handsome or
terribly smart...[BRK]

But he was a good man...and
now that he's been cleansed,
look at him![BRK]

He's cuckoo for cocoa puffs!
No...worse! What am I going
to do?



[END]

=== 1d | 96aa | 82 ===
There must be some way to
reverse the effects of the
cleansing...[BRK]

But how? If he stays like
this, I'll have to have him
committed![END]

=== 1e | 9740 | 7e ===
My husband seems to have
returned to normal.[BRK]

He's still a little confused
at times, but at least he's
not babbling nonsense...[END]

=== 1f | 97d2 | 9d ===
It's strange. My husband
dreams about his fit of
insanity,[BRK]

but he remembers nothing of
Serak Palace or the time
after that.[BRK]

Do you think Mauri did that,
too?[END]

=== 20 | 987e | ac ===
My husband has been very
distracted lately. I wonder
what's wrong.[BRK]

He won't talk about it, but
I think it has to do with
that cleansing![BRK]

I tell you, it's wrecked our
lives![END]

=== 21 | 993a | 40 ===
This is the second time a
great catastrophe has hit
our village.[END]

=== 22 | 9988 | 315 ===
The last catastrophe was a
terrible disease that killed
almost everyone here.[BRK]

The only person that got the
disease and survived to tell
about it was Mauri.[BRK]

Oh, and speaking of Mauri,
she left this letter for
you, in case you came back.[BRK]

I hope it's good news...[BRK]

[POR15]
Ronfar, my love,[BRK]

I sit here shrouded in a fog
of despair, enslaved to the
way of evil.[BRK]

I hate myself, but cannot
stop from performing the
rites.[BRK]

I am like a marionette at
the whim of a mad puppeteer.[BRK]

If you have returned and are
reading this, know that I
cannot go on like this.[BRK]

Please, if you have any love
left in your heart for me,
cut my strings...[BRK]

...regardless of the cost.[BRK]

                Love always,
                       Mauri[BRK]

[POR05]
I will find a way to free
you Mauri. And the only one
who will pay will be Zophar!

[END]

=== 23 | 9cb4 | 6a ===
It appears that everyone
struck by madness is now
sane again.[BRK]

I wonder if our prayers to
Althena helped...[END]

=== 24 | 9d2e | 71 ===
Hopefully, Raculi is done
with catastrophes! We've
had more than our share.[BRK]

But I guess only time will
tell, eh?
[END]

=== 25 | 9db2 | ed ===
I snuck into the palace and
saw the last cleansing![BRK]

If Mauri was cleansing the
people for the Goddess
Althena,[BRK]

why were they forced to
drink that blood-red
potion?![BRK]

[POR05]
Blood-red potion? Holy cow!
That's the same thing Mauri
drank when...[END]

=== 26 | 9eb6 | 87 ===
Was it really a cleansing
Mauri was performing?[BRK]

It looked more like some
sort of strange control
ritual...[BRK]

I'm scared. What's going on?[END]

=== 27 | 9f54 | a8 ===
All the people driven crazy
by the cleansing have
suddenly become sane again.[BRK]

I wonder if Mauri is now
okay, too?[BRK]

[POR05]
I'm hoping that she is,
sister.[BRK]

Boy, am I hoping...[END]

=== 28 | a018 | 34 ===
Does anyone know who was
actually controlling Mauri?[END]

=== 29 | a064 | b4 ===
Mauri has returned to our
village, but...[BRK]

Now her face looks kind and
gentle. It's much different
than at Serak Palace.[BRK]

She looks like she did
before she joined the
Althena Cult...[END]

=== 2a | a134 | 4f ===
I haven't seen Mauri look
this happy since she and 
Ronfar...[BRK]

...oh, Ronfar...
[END]

=== 2b | a194 | 32 ===
[POR05]
You mean since the time she
and I were in love?[END]

=== 2c | a1da | 65 ===
Ronfar and Mauri truly
belong together. [BRK]

Hoohmmhmm...I wish I could
find a man like Ronfar
someday...[END]

=== 2d | a24c | 90 ===
[POR05]
Keep lookin', sugarcakes.
They're out there...[BRK]

[POR02]
Good thing they're not all
just like Ronfar, though.[BRK]

I don't think the world
could take it.[END]

=== 2e | a2f0 | de ===
I don't understand why the
grownups are so confused
about the insanity.[BRK]

The cleansing at Serak
Palace is the cause![BRK]

I can tell the difference
when people come back from
it.[BRK]

They need to stop the
cleansing rites right away![END]

=== 2f | a3e6 | 70 ===
When my turn comes to go to
Serak Palace, I'm gonna
escape like logan did.[BRK]

He wasn't gonna let them
cleanse him![END]

=== 30 | a46a | 7f ===
I'm so glad the cleansing
ritual has been stopped![BRK]

I knew there was something
wrong with it all along,
but no one would listen![END]

=== 31 | a4f8 | 8b ===
I think the Cult of Althena
is actually going to change
for the better.[BRK]

Maybe now people will come
to know the true teachings
of Althena...[END]

=== 32 | a596 | 5d ===
Oh, Ronfar! Thank Althena
you've returned![BRK]

[POR05]
What're you talking about,
buddy? What's wrong?[END]

=== 33 | a60a | 99 ===
There are those that say
Mauri is the high priestess
of the cleansing.[BRK]

But I don't think that Mauri
is capable of doing such a
bad thing...[BRK]

[POR05]
....
.....[END]

=== 34 | a6ca | 96 ===
Leo just went running by,
and it looked like he was
mighty upset![BRK]

Did you two have some sort
of a fight?[BRK]

[POR05]
Oh no...Leo! Don't do
anything stupid...

[END]

=== 35 | a774 | 80 ===
There was some sort of weird
bright light that flashed,[BRK]

then the people who were
crazy seemed normal again.[BRK]

What was that light?[END]

=== 36 | a80c | cf ===
Mauri came back to Raculi
a while ago.[BRK]

Gossip around town has it
that she's waiting for you
to return.[BRK]

You'd better not worry her,
Ronfar...[BRK]

[POR05]
Thanks for the advice, but
I think that's between Mauri
and me![END]

=== 37 | a8f2 | 43 ===
It's days like this that
make me want to thank the
Goddess Althena![END]

=== 38 | a948 | 90 ===
You know, I've been
wondering when Ronfar and
Mauri are getting married.[BRK]

Don't you think they've been
engaged long enough? This
is ridiculous...[END]

=== 39 | a9ec | d4 ===
Hey, Ronfar, don't you think
you've kept Mauri waiting
long enough?[BRK]

Walk to the altar already!
Ya don't want ta let a good
woman slip your grip![BRK]

[POR05]
Hmm, gotcha, buddy. But ya
know, I've gotta be ready
for this...[END]

=== 3a | aace | 86 ===
[POR09]
Ronfar, if you wait 'til
you're ready, you'll never
do it...[BRK]

Take my advice and jump in
with both feet. I want to
call you brother![END]

=== 3b | ab68 | 8a ===
My big brother is acting
real weird ever since his
cleansing.[BRK]

He used to be nice, but now
all he does is talk about
some guy named Zophar.[END]

=== 3c | ac0a | 79 ===
My mom's got her hands full
taking care of my big
brother since he went crazy.[BRK]

Talk about a desperate ploy
for attention![END]

=== 3d | ac96 | 86 ===
Hey! Hey! Know what? My big
brother's back to his old
self again![BRK]

Yeah! Yeah! He plays ball
with me again. It's nice to
have him back.[END]

=== 3e | ad34 | 91 ===
Know what? Huh? Huh? There
was a beautiful lady that
came to that house.[BRK]

Yep! She was a total babe,
and she went in that house.
Her name's Mauri.[END]

=== 3f | add6 | f2 ===
[POR10]
Ha ha! Watch your roving
eye, kiddo. It'll get you in
trouble when you grow up![BRK]

[POR05]
Jean, don't scare the boy!
I've got a mighty fine
roving eye, and look at me![BRK]

[POR10]
Exactly my point. Look at
you! We don't want the kid
to turn out like that![END]

=== 40 | aee4 | b1 ===
Wanna see my new superhero
underwear?[BRK]

[POR02]
Not if you got 'em on.[BRK]

[POR00]
I do, but it's no big deal.
Lemme show you.[BRK]

[POR05]
Great! The kid's an
exhibitionist. Just what
this town needs...[END]

=== 41 | afa4 | 13c ===
I think I'm starting
puberty, 'cause I got a big
zit.[BRK]

[POR02]
Can't be that big. I don't
see anything.[BRK]

[POR00]
It's on my butt. I can prove
it to you, if you want.[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, no. Thanks. If you keep
your zitty butt in hiding,
we'll all be better off.[BRK]

Congrats on the puberty
thing, though...that's, uh,
hehe...really...um...nice.
[END]

=== 42 | b0f4 | 10a ===
Oh my! Oh my! What will I
do? What will I do?[BRK]

Tomorrow's my cleansing! But
if I go, I'm certain I'll
return here insane![BRK]

What shall I do?[BRK]

[POR02]
Duh! I've got a brainstorm![BRK]

Just don't show up![BRK]

[POR00]
You don't understand! They
send enforcers to come and
get you! Oh dear...
[END]

=== 43 | b216 | 87 ===
This is just terrible...
...terrible! What am I going
to do?[BRK]

If I don't show up for my
cleansing, the enforcers
will come...oh dear...
[END]

=== 44 | b2b4 | 8e ===
It was the strangest thing.
There was this warm flash, 
and everyone became normal.[BRK]

I'm not sure, but I think
the Goddess may have saved
us...[END]

=== 45 | b35e | 42 ===
I don't know how that light
came about, but I am so very
thankful![END]

=== 46 | b3b4 | 74 ===
Did you hear? The cleansing
at Serak Palace has been
abolished![BRK]

It was just a way for Zophar
to brainwash followers![END]

=== 47 | b43c | 9d ===
This used to be a little
speck on the map, but not
any more.[BRK]

This is the hometown of
Ronfar, Leo, and Mauri, who
saved our world![BRK]

They made this town famous![END]

=== 48 | b4f0 | 44 ===
Raculi is really popular now
that Ronfar, Leo, and Mauri
are famous.[END]

=== 49 | b542 | 12d ===
[POR07]
Hey...this is perfect! If
I can get those three to
live in Vane...[BRK]

...it'll be a huge draw for
tourists! I can see it now:[BRK]

Mauri mugs, Leo lights,
Ronfar rugs! It'll make a
mint![BRK]

And if I give them free
rent...they'll come for
sure![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, Lemina, don't you ever
give up? Sheesh, give it a
rest...
[END]

Raculi [END]

=== 4b | c2be | 4d ===
Hi! Hi! Come in! Come in!
We've got many great things.
What can I do for you?[END]

Good-bye! Good-bye! Please
come back anytime![END]

=== 4e | c99a | 8c ===
Oh, dear heavens! Ronfar, is
it really you? You've been
away so long![BRK]

Have you seen Mauri yet?
She's changed a lot since
you last saw her...[END]

=== 4f | ca3e | e3 ===
Leo and Mauri joined the
Althena Cult. Leo seems
pretty much the same,[BRK]

but Mauri has changed quite
radically, and not for the
better, I'm afraid.[BRK]

[POR05]
Damn! This is all my fault.
It's because of that potion
I gave her, I'm sure!
[END]

=== 50 | cb34 | 67 ===
Mauri came back to the
village full of sunshine and
life.[BRK]

It's as if she just awoke
from a bad dream...[END]

=== 51 | cbae | 78 ===
If Ronfar and Mauri decide
to live in Raculi, this town
will be prosperous.[BRK]

It seems both of them have
very good luck...[END]

=== 52 | cc3a | cb ===
Say, Ronfar, how's things
going between you and
Mauri?[BRK]

[POR05]
Like two lovebirds in a fur-
lined nest, buddy.[BRK]

Heaven, man...heaven![BRK]

She's paying so much
attention to me I think
Leo's a little jealous.






[END]

=== 53 | cd12 | 32 ===
[POR09]
Me? Jealous?[BRK]

Pah! I'm the happiest for
you two![END]

=== 54 | cd58 | d1 ===
Many of the people of the
village have gone to Serak
Palace to be cleansed.[BRK]

In fact, our daughter was
called a short while ago.[BRK]

I worry about her so much.
Bad things are happening in
that place...I've seen it.[END]

=== 55 | ce40 | 99 ===
Our only daughter was called
to the palace to be
cleansed.[BRK]

I worry that they will do
something to harm her.[BRK]

I just couldn't bear it if
she were harmed...[END]

=== 56 | ceec | 6a ===
The other residents of the
village have returned, but
not our daughter.[BRK]

I'm just beside myself with
worry![END]

=== 57 | cf74 | 84 ===
Thank Althena! Our daughter
finally came back from Serak
Palace.[BRK]

She says she doesn't
remember a thing after the
cleansing ceremony.[END]

=== 58 | cffc | 37 ===
I'm just so happy our
daughter is back, safe and
sound.[END]

=== 59 | d046 | ce ===
The light that cured the
villagers of their madness
is the power of Althena.[BRK]

My daughter says that is the
power she would like to show
the world...[BRK]

She's such an idealistic
young thing. I worry about
her...[END]

=== 5a | d128 | 80 ===
After the cleansing ritual,
I don't remember a thing.[BRK]

All I remember was the warm,
gentle light that brought me
back to reality.[END]

=== 5b | d1bc | dd ===
I'm starting to remember a
little of what happened
after the cleansing.[BRK]

It was very strange...kind
of like a blurry dream where
I had no control.[BRK]

Oohhh...I don't want to
think about it any more. I'm
just glad to be back.
[END]

=== 5c | d2b0 | 7e ===
Our world has been led
astray for too long...[BRK]

I've decided that my purpose

true teachings of Althena.[END]

[POR05]
...Leo![BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR09]
I've been waiting for you,
Ronfar. It's good to see you
again.[BRK]

How many years has it been
since you visited Raculi?[BRK]

I think the last time you
were here was during the
epidemic...[BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR05]
Leo...i...[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR09]
The disease was terrible. It
claimed the lives of every-
one who caught it...[BRK]

...except Mauri.[BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR05]
Leo...it was my fault...i
...I gave her the potion
that changed her...[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR09]
You musn't apologize. The
potion you gave her saved
her life.[BRK]

Even though she now is a
tortured soul, there is yet
hope of curing her.[BRK]

Without that potion, she
would have died like the
others...[BRK]

Ronfar, you have nothing to
be ashamed of. You did the
best you could.[BRK]

We must concentrate on
returning her to normal.[BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR05]
Leo?!! Is there a way to
bring her from the trance?
Don't give me false hope![BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR09]
....
.....there is a way, but...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR05]
But what, Leo?! Don't leave
me hanging!!



[END]

=== 5f | dd16 | 2f3 ===
[POR05]
Leo! Tell me how I can get
Mauri back to normal again![BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR09]
Ronfar...you gave Mauri the
potion that would save her
life...[BRK]

But you couldn't have known
what you gave her...[BRK]

...so I'll tell you. Ronfar,
that drink was the blood
of Zophar.[BRK]

It saved her life, but made
her a slave to the dark
master himself![BRK]

And now, she's 'cleansing'
the villagers one by one,
enslaving them, too.[BRK]

The only thing that can
restore her to us is the
power of Althena.[BRK]

But now that Mauri has
sealed the power of the Red
Dragon,[BRK]

Althena's power cannot be
unleashed. The situation
seems hopeless...[BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR05]
There must be a way! I can't
let Mauri down again...[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR09]
Unless you can unleash the
Red Dragon's power, I don't
see how you'll do it.[BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR05]
I will find a way. Bet on
it![END]

=== 60 | e012 | 285 ===
[POR05]
Leo has shown me the way
and blocked it at the same
time. Damn![BRK]

There's got to be a way to
unleash Althena's power and
save Mauri![BRK]

[POR08]
Ronfar, does the Aura of
Althena really exist?[BRK]

[POR05]
Yes, it was rumored to be in
Serak Palace...contained
within a stone.[BRK]

It's supposed to be a very
powerful stone.[BRK]

[POR08]
Yes, the stone contains the
essence of Althena's power.[BRK]

It might be enough to save
Mauri.[BRK]

[POR05]
Really? You think it's
powerful enough?[BRK]

And since Althena's power
is sealed, will it work?[BRK]

[POR08]
I don't know the answer to
those questions.[BRK]

But it's the only chance
you've got, Ronfar. You must
at least try...[BRK]

We must leave for Serak
Palace at once!

[END]

=== 61 | e2b6 | 152 ===
[POR15]
Oh, Ronfar! I knew that you
would one day come to rescue
me from that dark place.[BRK]

Each day was an eternity as
I was forced to do those
terrible things.[BRK]

Believe me when I say that
Zophar's power is beyond
description.[BRK]

He can control minds![BRK]

[POR05]
We must find a way to defeat
him, Mauri. If he's allowed
to continue,[BRK]

he'll destroy us all!

[END]

=== 62 | e428 | d4 ===
[POR15]
Ronfar, I pray for your safe
return to me one day.[BRK]

Know that I will always love
you...[BRK]

[POR05]
I'll be back for you in
two shakes of an old dog's
leg, sugar-snap![BRK]

Once we defeat this Zophar
dude, I'm allllll yours![END]

=== 63 | e514 | f3 ===
[POR15]
I know you will emerge
victorious from this dark
hour...[BRK]

You have the light of
Althena to guide you through
Zophar's darkness.[BRK]

He can try to cloud your
vision, but he cannot darken
the way.[BRK]

Trust in your heart and stay
true to yourself...

.....Mauri...[END]

=== 65 | e644 | 7e ===
[POR15]
Ha! Hiro...and Ruby! You two
are certainly a sight for
sore eyes![BRK]

So, what are you up to now?
Adventuring around the
world?[END]

=== 66 | e6de | 149 ===
[POR15]
Leo...brother...[BRK]

[POR09]
Mauri, I know we've had our
differences in the past,
but...[BRK]

[POR15]
Stop! Don't even mention the
past. All is forgiven.[BRK]

I don't blame you for what
happened. You had no way of
knowing...[BRK]

[POR09]
Sister, you are kind beyond
words.[BRK]

I don't deserve the
forgiveness you give so
easily,[BRK]

but I will accept it. Thank
you...
[END]

=== 67 | e846 | 2cf ===
[POR15]
Leo, please consider staying
here with us in Raculi.[BRK]

We can always use another
skilled hand in the village.[BRK]

[POR09]
Give me time, Mauri.
Adventuring is in my soul.[BRK]

I don't know if I can give
it all up and settle down.[BRK]

[POR15]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR09]
Oh, Mauri! You're giving me
that look again![BRK]

Don't worry! I'm fine. I
just have some things to
work out, that's all.[BRK]

I'm going to find a very
isolated place to sort it
all out...[BRK]

I can promise you one thing,
though.[BRK]

If you and Ronfar have a
little one, I'll be back
to baby-sit in a second![BRK]

I want to see what kind of
kids this joker can sire!
Ha ha ha![BRK]

[POR15]
Well, if that's the best I
can get, I'll take it.[BRK]

Just know that we're always
here for you...[BRK]

[POR05]
...always. Remember that,
buddy.[END]

=== 68 | eb34 | 138 ===
[POR09]
The quickest way to get me
back here is by having some
nieces and nephews for me![BRK]

That is...if you think your
gambler's got any idea
how...[BRK]

[POR05]
I'll make an effort, Leo.[BRK]

[POR02]
I think the biggest effort
will be getting Mauri to
buy his act...[BRK]

...when she finds out his
package is tied with a tiny
bow...[BRK]

Ha ha ha![END]

=== 69 | ec88 | 15f ===
[POR15]
Hiro, I know that you and
Lucia care for one another.[BRK]

And as one who was torn
from her true love, I know
that pain.[BRK]

If Ronfar hadn't come in
my darkest hour, I don't
know if I...[BRK]

[POR05]
...Mauri.[BRK]

[POR15]
Please, Hiro, go to Lucia.
You are the one she wants.[BRK]

You hold the key to the
happiness she seeks. Use it
to free her spirit.[BRK]

You belong with her.[BRK]

Go...
[END]

=== 6a | ee06 | bf ===
[POR15]
Say, have you any idea where
my brother Leo has run off
to?[BRK]

I know he said he'd be fine,
but I worry...[BRK]

[POR05]
Don't worry, Mauri. He said
he'd be back, and he's never
gone back on his word...[END]

=== 6b | ef24 | 188 ===
[POR05]
Hiro...buddy! Long time no
see! Say, what brings you
back to Raculi?[BRK]

Oh, I see...the old ruins,
hm? Why do you want to find
them? And where's Lucia?[BRK]

Holy cow! She left you? Well
now, I never saw that one
coming![BRK]

You musta had some fight for
her to go back to the Blue
Star![BRK]

You know, she loves you,
kiddo.[BRK]

And for the sake of true
love, I'll help anyone out.
So are you asking for help?


[END]

=== 6c | f0b0 | 2c ===
[0x5]No, Mauri needs you.
Yes! I need your help![END]

=== 6d | f0ec | a0 ===
[POR05]
Well, if you're concerned
about Mauri's welfare, why'd
you come here?[BRK]

I mean, were you just
lookin' for a shoulder to
cry on?[BRK]

Sheesh, kid, make up your
mind![END]

=== 6e | f1a2 | 158 ===
[POR05]
Okay, I'm ready to help you
out. I just need to say bye
to Mauri.[BRK]

[POR15]
Oh, Ronfar, off again?[BRK]

[POR05]
Dumplin', if he wasn't the
greatest guy in the world,
I wouldn't go.[BRK]

But he is, and I've got to
help him out. I'll be back
before you know it.[BRK]

[POR15]
Well then, good luck, sugar
buns. I'll be waiting.[BRK]

[POR05]
Okay, Hiro, ya got a hired
hand in your party![END]

=== 6f | f322 | 91 ===
[POR05]
Hey, kiddo, I want you to
know Mauri wouldn't have
let me go if it wasn't...[BRK]

...for a very old friend.
Count yourself lucky, buddy!
Ha ha ha!

If we don't find Althena's
aura stone soon, his mind
will be gone forever...[END]

Wha...what am I doing back
here in my house?[BRK]

The last thing I remember
was that I was about to
start my cleansing...[BRK]

...after that, everything's
a blank.[END]

=== 74 | fb9e | 7b ===
I-it...was like I was in a
bad dream. A voice kept
saying 'Zophar,' [BRK]

And all I could see was a
dark fog wherever I looked.
[END]

=== 75 | fc28 | 88 ===
You know, even when I was
under Zophar's control, I
was looking for light.[BRK]

Maybe Althena gave me the
desire to break free from
Zophar...[END]

=== 76 | fcc0 | fd ===
My son is an eager follower
of the Althena Cult members.[BRK]

But if you ask me, they're
nothin' but trouble![BRK]

There's somethin' wrong
about that 'cleansing'
ritual, I just know it...[BRK]

After my son returned from
his, he's been babbling
nothin' but nonsense...
[END]

=== 77 | fdd0 | 66 ===
Oh! Thank Althena! My son is
back to normal! This is a
miracle![BRK]

I never thought he'd return
to normal.[END]

=== 78 | fe46 | b3 ===
My son hasn't given up
believing in the Goddess,[BRK]

but he has sworn off the
rites of the Althena Cult.[BRK]

I sleep much better at night
knowing he's not hanging
around those weirdoes...[END]
