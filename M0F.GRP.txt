Halt! You have no business
aboard the dragon steam-
ship destiny![BRK]

You'd better leave before
lord leo returns from
gwyn's house![END]

=== 1 | 14322 | 49 ===
[POR02]
Hiro? What is lord leo
doing at grandpa's house?
We'd better find out![END]

=== 2 | 1437e | 8e ===
This is the dragonship
destiny, pride of the
entire althena guard![BRK]

What? Lord leo? He's
retired to his quarters.
You'd better not bother him.
[END]

=== 3 | 1441a | 43 ===
[POR04]
But i must tell him of
the events at the blue
tower! Let us in!
[END]

=== 4 | 1446c | 3b ===
This area is off-limits
without the permission
of lord leo.[END]

=== 5 | 144b6 | 67 ===
Halt! Who goes there?![BRK]

Freakin' thrill-seekers!
If ya don't vacate the ship
right now, i'll haul ya in![END]

=== 6 | 1452c | 82 ===
The dragonship destiny was
given to lord leo by the
goddess althena.[BRK]

It is equipped with a mighty
white dragon cannon at its
bow.
[END]

=== 7 | 145be | 8f ===
We are retained by the
goddess althena herself to
keep our world from harm.[BRK]

This ship draws on her
power, and lord leo
answers directly to her.[END]

=== 8 | 1465c | b9 ===
The goddess althena is
fairest of the fair.[BRK]

I saw her once, and i'll
never forget it...[BRK]

That milky skin, the curve
of her hips...those smooth,
supple br...[BRK]

.............uh, never mind!

[POR09]
Ha ha ha ha!
Is that everything you've
got, my boy?[BRK]

With such paltry skill,
you don't stand a chance
of changing anything![END]

=== a | 147c6 | c0 ===
[POR09]
Hiro, your skill is without
equal. Perhaps you are the
one of legend.[BRK]

Please take this. It holds
the power of the white
dragon within it.[BRK]

[POR00]
[0xB][0][0x4]Received the white dragon
aura from lord leo.[END]

=== b | 14890 | d3 ===
[POR09]
The white dragon sleeps
within the iceberg of the
north sea.[BRK]

Take my ship. It will get
you there swiftly. You've
no time to waste![BRK]

Take to the seas outside
meribia and use the helm
of the destiny to navigate.[END]

=== c | 1496c | 10b ===
[POR09]
The time has come for me
to relinquish command of
the destiny.[BRK]

Take the helm, hiro. You are
now the destiny's captain.[BRK]

I cannot remain with you to
fight, so it is here that
we must part ways.[BRK]

[POR01]
But...leo.[BRK]

[POR09]
Fight bravely, fight well,
and most of all fight fair.
[END]

=== d | 14a96 | 67 ===

Come on, lad! I know you
can do better than that![BRK]

I'll give you another shot.
Concentrate this time![END]

[POR02]
Hey! Hey, hiro! Let's get
this ship moving![BRK]

Didn't leo say that we
could move the ship from
the helm?[BRK]

Hop to it, buster![END]

=== 10 | 14bd2 | 18a ===
[POR02]
Hiro! Lucia! Look! It's the
port of pentagulia![BRK]

[POR08]
I'm certain that althena's
impostor has closed the
transmission spring by now.[BRK]

So the only way to get back
to althena's tower will be
to break zophar's seal.[BRK]

Once we arrive, i can try to
use dragonpower to break it.[BRK]

Hopefully there will be
enough power...and then...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Oh, althena must trust me,
even if the result is...[BRK]

[POR01]
.....?

=== 11 | 14d66 | 1f0 ===
[ROR08]
I know your plan, ghaleon.[BRK]

You have joined with zophar
to destroy this world![BRK]

[ROR14]
Me? Destroy the world?
Oh dear, that sounds so,
so...barbaric.[BRK]

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmm...[BRK]

I love it.[BRK]

But don't confuse my
intentions, sweet child.[BRK]

I fully intend to recreate
the world with zophar once
the impurities are removed.[BRK]

And i've decided to start
my impurity abatement 
program with you, lucia.[BRK]

Wave bye-bye to your little
boyfriend, dear.[BRK]

I sense a coming....chill
in your relationship...[BRK]

Ha ha ha ha ha!


[END]

=== 12 | 14f60 | 2f3 ===
[ROR14]
Hrmph! What a seriously
confused little boy.[BRK]

If he had minded his own
business, he'd still be
alive.[BRK]

But now that he's out of
the way, lucia is all mine![BRK]

[ROR08]
Hiro!?...hiro!!!
Nooooooo![BRK]

[ROR14]
....
.....[BRK]

[ROR08]
Hiro! Why did you...[BRK]

[ROR14]
Ha ha ha! Poor, lost, little
lucia. You care for hiro
more than yourself.[BRK]

That's so touching. You
know, there is a way you can
save your true love...[BRK]

If you were to give me the
secret of the blue tower's
true power, i could...[BRK]

[ROR08]
Ghaleon! How do you know
about the blue tower's
secret power?![BRK]

[ROR14]
Ha ha ha. I know many 
things, my dear.[BRK]

I also know that you now 
control the destiny of your
little hiro.[BRK]

Go to pentagulia and finish
your mission, or return to 
the blue tower to save hiro.[BRK]

It's up to you...hm hm hm
hm hm hm...

[END]

=== 13 | 15274 | 16e ===
[POR02]
Oh no! Hiro! Hiro!
Lucia, you have to save
hiro! Please???[BRK]

[POR05]
Looks like our luck's taken
a turn for the worse...
damn that ghaleon![BRK]

[POR07]
If ghaleon can change a
human into crystal, who can
stop him?[BRK]

[POR10]
Lucia has the power to save
hiro and stop ghaleon...he
said it himself...[BRK]

[POR08]
If i use the secret power of
the blue tower, i can save
hiro...[BRK]

...but that would...
[END]

[POR08]
....
.....hiro.[BRK]

If the world is destroyed
because of my decision,
you'll never forgive me.[BRK]

Before i met you, my 
thoughts were so clear.[BRK]

I had simply to come here
and accomplish my simple
mission. But now...[BRK]

Oh, hiro! What shall i do?
Nothing makes sense anymore.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Regardless of what happens,
know that i will always...[BRK]

[POR02]
...lucia! It's the blue
tower! We're here! Let's
get moving and restore hiro![BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

...okay, ruby. I'm coming.[END]

=== 15 | 155e0 | 1cd ===
[POR01]
C'mon, lucia! Grandpa
gwyn is waiting for us![BRK]

[POR08]
Yes, i suppose we should
continue on...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...but...[BRK]

[POR01]
But what, lucia?
What's the matter?[BRK]

[POR08]
No...nothing. Forget it.[BRK]

I'm just glad to know
that someone will always
be here for me.[BRK]

[POR01]
That's kind of a weird
thing to say out of the
blue...[BRK]

Of course you'll always
have me around![BRK]

[POR08]
Y-you're right. From now
on, no more bad thoughts![BRK]

Okay. As ruby would say,[BRK]

'let's get this show on
the road, hiro!'
[END]

=== 16 | 157ba | 229 ===
[POR01]
Penny for your thoughts,
lucia.[BRK]

[POR08]
Hmm? Oh, hiro.[BRK]

[POR01]
You seemed to be lost in
pretty deep thought. What
were you thinking about?[BRK]

[POR08]
Oh, nothing, really...[BRK]

I-i was just wishing we
could continue this journey
forever...[BRK]

I know it's silly.[BRK]

[POR01]
Oh, lucia. It's not that
stupid.[BRK]

I've had that same thought
myself. Ya know, after we
visit gramps,[BRK]

we can take the destiny and
start another adventure![BRK]

Whaddaya think? Cool, huh?[BRK]

[POR08]
That sounds lovely, hiro.
I'd die to do that...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

[POR01]
Okay then! We'll call it
a plan! I can't wait!
This'll be great!
[END]

=== 17 | 159ec | fc ===
[POR01]
It looks like we're here.
We'd better get moving! I
can't wait to tell grand--[BRK]

[POR08]
...wait! Hiro, i'd like to
stop at the blue tower,
first.[BRK]

[POR01]
But...lucia? Why can't we
visit grandpa gwyn first?[BRK]

[POR08]
Please hiro? For me?[BRK]

[POR01]
...okay, lucia. For you.


[END]

=== 18 | 15b10 | b9 ===
[POR02]
Remember, leo said the cave
of the white dragon was in
an iceberg by the north sea.[BRK]

If we leave meribia's port
and head west, we're sure
to find it.[BRK]

Let's go, hiro! Adventure
awaits![END]

=== 19 | 15bfc | 51 ===
[POR09]
There's no time for
indecision, lad! Zophar
will be here any time![BRK]

Let's move![END]

=== 1a | 15c60 | bf ===
[POR08]
Oh, hiro. You sacrificed
your life, so that i 
could live.[BRK]

I owe you everything.[BRK]

[POR02]
Lucia, we have to hurry
and get to the blue spire
to restore hiro.[BRK]

[POR08]
But there's no time.
Zophar is...
[END]

=== 1b | 15d32 | 83 ===
[POR08]
Oh, hiro! How can i even
consider leaving you in
this state?![BRK]

There must be a way to
revive you and still take
care of zophar...[END]

=== 1c | 15dc2 | 4f ===
[POR08]
But my first priority is
to use the power of the 
blue spire to revive you.
[END]

=== 1d | 15e28 | 1eb ===
[POR05]
Are you going to save 
hiro by using the power
of the blue spire?[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

Ronfar, continue the course
to pentagulia.[BRK]

[POR05]
But that's the opposite
direction of the blue spire![BRK]

If you don't go there and
restore hiro, that will be
the....end...of.....him...[BRK]

[POR02]
He was stricken trying to
save your life! How can you
turn your back on him now?[BRK]

[POR08]
Ruby, please understand. I
must accomplish my task, or
all will be...[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm not listening! La la la
la la la la la la la la la 
la la la.....[END]

=== 1e | 1602a | 2e7 ===
[POR05]
Listen, i know how important
it is not to let zophar 
revive, [BRK]

but i will not let hiro die
like this! I'm going to the
port at dalton.[BRK]

I can take him to the blue
spire from there.[BRK]

Maybe i can figure out how
to revive him. You can do
what you want.[BRK]

[POR08]
Ronfar, you don't understand
anything![BRK]

If zophar revives before
althena, he will seize
althena's power,[BRK]

and become the most powerful
being in the universe,[BRK]

with the absolute power of
creation and destruction.[BRK]

Once his evil is infused
with this power, it will be
the end of everything![BRK]

This is our only chance to
stop him.[BRK]

[POR02]
But lucia...[BRK]

[POR08]
I am lucia, guardian of the
blue star. I came here to
save the world.[BRK]

I must continue my mission,
regardless of the cost.[BRK]

Do what you must, ronfar.
[END]

=== 1f | 1631a | 49 ===
[POR05]
But lucia...wait! This
is the last chance to save
hiro![BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....
[END]

=== 20 | 1637a | 106 ===
[POR05]
I knew you'd change your
mind, lucia.[BRK]

I know that you are gambling
with the fate of both our
worlds to do this.[BRK]

But you're doing the right
thing by going to the blue
spire first to save hiro.[BRK]

Trust me...it'll all be
peachy keen, jelly bean.
...you'll see...

[END]

=== 21 | 16494 | 9b ===
[POR10]
Lucia...why do you hesitate?
You aren't thinking of
letting hiro die, are you?[BRK]

I know you're not that
cold-hearted! You simply
can't be...[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[END]

=== 22 | 16542 | 98 ===
[POR10]
Whew! For a while there, I
was worried that you were
going to let hiro die![BRK]

But you've now shown that
you have the one trait I
prize most: integrity.[END]

=== 23 | 165ee | b4 ===
[POR07]
With money, practically
anything is possible...[BRK]

But i'm pretty sure that
there's no way we can buy
hiro back from the dead.[BRK]

You've got to save him,
lucia![BRK]

[POR08]
But lemina...i...

[END]

=== 24 | 166b6 | 90 ===

lucia...[BRK]

Too bad you've always got
ruby hanging around...[BRK]

[POR02]
What do you mean, jean?
Are you saying i'm a
pain in hiro's butt?[BRK]

You take that back![BRK]

[POR01]
Sheesh, ruby! You sure
do yelp when jean yanks
your chain. Calm down.[BRK]

She's just joking...[BRK]

.............i think.

[POR10]
Oh...pentagulia![BRK]

Look at me! I'm quivering
in anticipation of what's
going to happen.[BRK]

I wonder if lunn is still
there?

[END]

=== 5b | 19fb0 | 113 ===
[POR07]
What? Lucia? Oh, she left
here a moment ago.[BRK]

I don't know where she
went. I wish i did, though.[BRK]

These guards are so ga-ga
over her, they'd pay just
to oogle![BRK]

[POR02]
Pay? Oogle? What are you?
Some sort of greedy little
profiteer in a dress?[BRK]

[POR07]
I'm simply a good business
woman![END]

=== 5c | 1a0de | a4 ===
[POR07]
We're almost to pentagulia![BRK]

I'm going to show that no-
good toad borgan my true
power![BRK]

Oh, mother! Hold on just a
little longer...i'll find
a way to release you![END]

=== 5d | 1a1ae | b9 ===
Ya know, this is my first
trip to pentagulia. I've
kinda got the jitters.[BRK]

[POR02]
Calm down, jim. You just
need to switch to sanka
brand decaffeinated coffee.[BRK]

Try it! You'll be glad you
did.[END]

=== 5e | 1a282 | 4b ===
I'd give anything to be in
your shoes! Going to see
the goddess...sheesh!

[END]

=== 5f | 1a2e4 | 7e ===
With the speed of the
destiny on our side, we'll
arrive at pentagulia soon.[BRK]

It's just a short distance
from the port of azado.[END]

=== 60 | 1a37e | 43 ===
Pentagulia...pentagulia...
hmmm, i wonder what the
city name means?[END]

=== 61 | 1a3d4 | 51 ===
I told you we'd get here in
no time flat! The destiny is
the fastest ship around![END]

=== 62 | 1a438 | 57 ===
Since lord leo has 
granted you guest status,[BRK]

you can go wherever you
wish on the ship.[END]

=== 63 | 1a4a2 | 77 ===
Lord leo told us of his
mercy toward the girl.[BRK]

He's supposed to execute
her, but instead, he's 
letting althena decide.[END]

=== 64 | 1a530 | 90 ===
I wonder what's for lunch
today?[BRK]

Lately, the mess hall's been
serving up some pretty
rancid slop.[BRK]

I'm kinda afraid to even
check the daily menu![END]

=== 65 | 1a5d8 | 74 ===
Even though this world is
immense, we can get to
any point very quickly.[BRK]

Mark my words, we'll soon
be at pentagulia.[END]

=== 66 | 1a668 | 78 ===
Since you are guests of
lord leo, you have free
reign of the ship.[BRK]

All i ask is that you don't
bother the crew too much.[END]

=== 67 | 1a6f8 | bc ===
Say there, you look a little
blue. Are you feeling okay?[BRK]

[POR02]
I think it's called 'sea-
sickness.'[BRK]

It's okay as long as i keep
flying, but when i land,
look out below![BRK]

Some adventurers, huh?[END]

=== 68 | 1a7ba | e ===
The destiny b2[END]

=== 69 | 1b860 | 1f ===
[POR02]
Hey! That sounds like
lucia![END]

=== 6a | 1b882 | 1a4 ===
[POR08]
But you're only a human!
You can't possibly under-
stand![BRK]

I must see althena in
person! Your world hangs in
the balance![BRK]

[POR09]
Hold on there, miss. First,
i want to know why you came
to our world...[BRK]

What's your real plan?[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR09]
Answer me![BRK]

[POR08]
I...i can't. You wouldn't
understand...you're only...
...human.[BRK]

[POR09]
Excuses, excuses! You are 
a miserable liar, [BRK]

and, i now have no choice
but to carry out my orders.
[END]

=== 6b | 1ba2a | 5d ===
[POR09]
Engage the force field, and
let no one open it without
me personally present![BRK]

[POR00]
Yes, sir![END]

=== 6c | 1ba8a | 58 ===
[POR09]
Your crime is treason. Your
sentence: execution.[BRK]

You will be hanged tomorrow
at noon.[END]

=== 6d | 1bae6 | 153 ===
Sir, is it true that she is
the destroyer that was
foretold to ruin our land?[BRK]

She looks so...so normal.
I can't believe that she
has that kind of power.[BRK]

[POR09]
Ah, never let the curve of
a hip or the charm in a
woman's eyes sway you.[BRK]

Many a man has made that
mistake, to their eternal
damnation.[BRK]

I just hope althena's right
about this one...

[END]

=== 6e | 1bc50 | e2 ===
[POR08]
Ohh! Hiro....and ruby![BRK]

What are you doing here?
Don't you know you'll be
killed if they catch you?[BRK]

[POR02]
Duh! We didn't think they
were going to throw us a
huge party![BRK]

[POR08]
Then hurry! We must get
out of here before leo
returns![END]

=== 6f | 1bd4e | 134 ===
[POR09]
Damn! I fell for the
oldest trick in the book![BRK]

Don't think you'll get
away with this! I won't
rest until you're found![BRK]

You idiots don't have a
prayer of success![BRK]

[POR02]
Nee ner, nee ner, nee ner!
Seems like leo is running
on about half a brain.[BRK]

Looks like he's the idiot!
Hee hee. Let's get out of
here, hiro.[END]

=== 70 | 1be9e | c4 ===
[POR09]
Sure! Run away like the
cowards you are, hiro and
ronfar! But remember this:[BRK]

My mission is to capture and
execute that monster you're
helping...[BRK]

I won't give up until the
task is accomplished.
[END]

=== 71 | 1bf76 | db ===
[POR08]
If i don't make it to see
althena before zophar comes,
we're all in danger.[BRK]

But in my current form, I
cannot protect even myself.[BRK]

In this form, meeting the
goddess althena will be
very...[BRK]

Oh, hiro, what should i do?
[END]

=== 72 | 1c054 | 2f ===
[0x5]I want to see althena.
Let's go to pentagulia.[END]

=== 73 | 1c092 | 46 ===
[POR01]
I want to see althena, too.
If she really is here, 
she'll help us.[END]

=== 74 | 1c0e8 | 4a ===
[POR01]
Let's go to pentagulia. I
think the answer to our
problem lies there...[END]

=== 75 | 1c136 | 213 ===
[POR01]
Lucia, i'll help you until
we get to see the goddess.[BRK]

This will be the start of
a great adventure.[BRK]

I can feel it...[BRK]

[POR08]
But hiro, my task is very
dangerous. It is one that
you cannot fully understand.[BRK]

[POR02]
Yeah, hiro! Are you sure
you want to help her?[BRK]

I mean, lord leo wants
to kill her, and now he
wants us, too![BRK]

Besides, i think she's
crowdin' our little party.[BRK]

[POR08]
I'm sorry if i've offended
you, ruby. [BRK]

I meant you no harm. Perhaps
it would be better if I
left.[BRK]

[POR05]
Hey! Pipe down, you guys...
someone's coming! Get outta
sight![END]

=== 76 | 1c352 | 29 ===
[POR09]
What...? Why has the door
been opened?[END]

=== 77 | 1c37e | b2 ===
[POR09]
Damn! She's escaped! That
little fox somehow out-
smarted me![BRK]

I bet her little friends
have something to do with
this![BRK]

Guards! Guards! Come
quickly! The destroyer has
escaped![END]

=== 78 | 1c448 | 25 ===
[POR08]
Thank you, hiro, ronfar,
and ruby.[END]

=== 79 | 1c476 | c7 ===
[POR08]
Why does leo want to
kill me? Who has ordered
my death?[BRK]

I just don't understand.
He said that he's working
for althena...[BRK]

[POR02]
I don't understand his
mission, either. But he
is in althena's guard...[END]

=== 7a | 1c554 | 43 ===
[POR02]
What the heck are you
doing, hiro? We don't
have time for games![END]

=== 7b | 1c5b0 | 59 ===
[POR09]
What the.....![BRK]

Damn! What are you doing,
ronfar?!!![BRK]

Why are you with these
criminals?![END]

=== 7c | 1c616 | 2f ===
[POR02]
Ha ha, hiro! You showed
lord leo who's boss![END]

=== 7d | 1c648 | 95 ===
[POR09]
Do you idiots know what
you've done?[BRK]

That girl will be the end
of us all![BRK]

[POR05]
Hey there, leo! We've got
our reasons, old bud![BRK]

Trust me on this one![END]

=== 7e | 1c6f8 | 54 ===
[POR02]
H-h-hey! Don't open that.
Leave him locked in there![BRK]

We've gotta get outta here!
[END]

=== 7f | 1c7a8 | 35 ===
[POR05]
Hey...hiro! Why don't we
lock leo in his own cell?[END]

=== 80 | 1c7f8 | 45 ===
[POR05]
Wait here a second. I'd
like to share a few choice
words with leo.[END]

=== 81 | 1c840 | 1d9 ===
[POR09]
Ronfar, what could you
possibly have to say to
me now?!![BRK]

[POR05]
I just wanted to say that
i'm going with hiro to
pentagulia.[BRK]

Thought you'd like to
know...[BRK]

[POR09]
Don't you know that girl
will be the end of our
world? She's insane![BRK]

[POR05]
I don't think so, old bud.[BRK]

I believe that she holds the
key to something we don't
yet understand.[BRK]

I'm going to help her to
accomplish her mission,[BRK]

and if that means going
to pentagulia, so be it.[BRK]

Besides, i can use the
opportunity to see mauri.[END]

=== 82 | 1ca1c | af ===
[POR05]
Thanks for waiting up,
hiro. Let's make tracks
for pentagulia.[BRK]

If we head out from dalton
and go north,[BRK]

we can get to pentagulia
by crossing through the
forest of illusion.[END]
