Whoa! Mega-cool! The old
thing actually works![BRK]

You know, I don't think
anyone has been down here
for centuries![BRK]

In the old days, this cave
was used as a sort of magic
skill 'final exam.'[BRK]

It separated those that were
worthy to join the Guild
from those that weren't.[BRK]

Anyway...that's ancient
history...We've got a job
to do. Let's get moving.[BRK]

But be careful! I don't
know what kind of freaks
lurk in this creepy joint!

Hey, Hiro![BRK]

Any kind of treasures we
find in here are mine![BRK]

So keep your hands off
of them![END]

Hiro, if I were you, I
wouldn't open those chests
without asking Lemina first.[BRK]

She seems to think that
they're all property of
Vane...[BRK]

And by extension...
property of Lemina.

Hiro! How dare you![BRK]

These are obviously private
jewel chests.[BRK]

Leave them to me![END]

=== 5 | 12cd6 | 36 ===
[POR02]
Hiro, I think we'd better
leave the chests alone...[END]

Hiro![BRK]

These chests are ancient
historical treasures![BRK]

You have no right to take
them! I thought you'd know
better than that![END]

=== 8 | 14150 | 58 ===
[POR02]
Um, it's probably better
if we don't open this.[BRK]

If we do, Lemina might blow
a gasket![END]

Hiro! I would have never
pegged you as a thief![BRK]

But how else can I explain
why you're trying to kipe
Vane's ancient treasures?![END]

=== b | 15318 | 5a ===
[POR02]
Um, let's not rock the
boat, Hiro.[BRK]

I think Lemina's pretty
attached to these treasures.[END]

[POR07]
Hiro, if it wasn't for me
you wouldn't even be here![BRK]

So keep your grubby mitts
off the treasures, okay?[END]

=== e | 16738 | 6b ===
[POR02]
I think we better not touch
anything in these chests![BRK]

If we do, Lemina just might
have a conniption fit.[END]

Master Lunn, we must fight
one more time.[BRK]

It's the only way that I 
can know if my skills are
truly complete.[BRK]

I must know before my
battle with Zophar!![END]

=== 10 | 16878 | a7 ===
[POR10]
This will be my last time I
use Blue Dragon Karate.[BRK]

Once we've defeated Zophar,
I will never again practice
this deadly ancient art.[BRK]

The knowledge will die with
me.[END]

=== 11 | 1693a | a3 ===
[POR10]
Lucia cannot die! We must
all band together to save
her from this fate![BRK]

If she dies, our world is
certain to perish also![BRK]

We must find a way to
overcome Zophar![END]

=== 12 | 169f4 | 117 ===
[POR16]
Practice hard, Jean! Your
power has surpassed mine,
but Zophar is stronger yet![BRK]

Remember when you fight 
him that the real enemy
lies within yourself.[BRK]

If you let your fear take 
hold of you, you'll be 
powerless to stop him.[BRK]

Control your fear and your
victory will be assured.[END]

=== 13 | 16b26 | ca ===
[POR16]
Jean, once Zophar is
defeated, you must forget
all that I have taught you.[BRK]

Learn from my mistakes and
pursue the true teachings of
Althena instead.[BRK]

You must never again use the
Black Karate of Death.[END]

=== 14 | 16c04 | fd ===
[POR16]
Jean...Go now and complete
your destiny.[BRK]

Remember all that I have
taught you and you will
find success.[BRK]

[POR10]
Master Lunn...I can never
forgive what you did to
me,[BRK]

but your sincerity gives
me hope for our future...[BRK]

I will fight valiantly
to preserve it![END]
