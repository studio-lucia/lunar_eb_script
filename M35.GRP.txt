Forget it![BRK]

There's no way we're gonna
break this barrier without
Dragonpower.

What are you waiting for,
Lucia? Pentagulia awaits.[BRK]

Now you can finish the
mission that cost you your
only true friend.[BRK]

[POR08]
Yes, my mission nears its
end.[BRK]

But instead of joy, all
I feel is pain...[BRK]

As if a burning knife twists
within my heart, scraping
away my soul, my life...[BRK]

.....
......[BRK]

[POR02]
Well, duh![BRK]

Your pain is because you've
abandoned Hiro.[BRK]

It's your choice: antacids
and guilt forever, or turn
around now and rescue Hiro.[BRK]

[POR08]
But if I don't go to Penta-
gulia now, Zophar will take
control and the world will--[BRK]

[POR02]
will what? Explode? Implode?
Turn into a giant tin of
sardines?[BRK]

C'mon, Lucia! You're placing
true love on the altar of
trust and spitting on it![BRK]

Show a little respect! You
know what's right, so just
do it![BRK]

[POR08]
You don't understand...
The danger is...[BRK]

[POR02]
...still gonna be there when
we get back, so let's go
revive Hiro now![BRK]

[POR08]
Oh, Ruby, I hope Hiro knows
what a true friend you are.[BRK]

All right, let's go to
the Blue Spire so I can
resurrect Hiro.

Oouuhh, I can feel the evil
coursing through this place.
Zophar is here. I know it.[BRK]

[POR05]
But are you sure? Is it
possible that he's already
revived?[BRK]

[POR08]
Not completely. We may still
have time, if we can find
Althena.[BRK]

But first we must summon
the Dragons to help destroy
the barrier.[BRK]

That will open the way to
the Goddess Tower...
