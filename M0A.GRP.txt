Hm, hm, hm...[BRK]

You have simply no chance
of defeating me, so why do
you persist?[BRK]

The magic powers of old have
died out, and there is no
hope for your world.[BRK]

Now, throw your very lives
before me that I may spare
your miserable souls...[BRK]

Or...fight me if you dare![BRK]

[POR05]
Hey, buster, you seem pretty
confident about a fight that
hasn't even begun![BRK]

[POR10]
We'd never surrender to the
likes of you! Forget about
it, Ghaleon![BRK]

[POR07]
Even though I don't have my
magic to rely on, I'll still
kick your sorry butt![BRK]

[POR09]
I'll never again submit to
the powers of darkness![BRK]

I will resist you with every
fiber of my being!



[END]

=== 1 | ce86 | d6 ===
[POR02]
That's right! If we all
fight together, we can beat
Ghaleon at his own game![BRK]

[POR14]
Hm, hm, hm, hm...you poor
delusional souls![BRK]

I suppose I'd be sad, if I
had a heart...[BRK]

...but I don't. Prepare
to witness my fury!

[END]

=== 2 | cf7a | 7f ===
[POR14]
Hiro, take my sword. You'll
need an advantage against
Zophar...[BRK]

I pray it serves you well...[BRK]

[POR00]
[0xB][0]Kreceived Ghaleon's sword.[END]

=== 3 | d002 | 57 ===
[POR14]
Though I cannot go with you,
know that I will be there in
spirit always. Good-bye...[END]

=== 4 | d0b2 | c ===
...Lemina!

[END]

=== 5 | d0c8 | 1da ===
Oh, Lemina! Thank Althena
you've come back! We're in
big trouble!!![BRK]

[POR07]
Big trouble? What are you
talking about? Did you lose
your purse again?[BRK]

[POR00]
No. No! No!! Borgan has come
to Vane![BRK]

[POR07]
Borgan? You mean...that big,
fat, evil...[BRK]

[POR00]
Yes! That Borgan! He said he
wanted to talk with your
mother, Miria.[BRK]

We tried to stop him and
the party of magicians he
brought,[BRK]

but they were just too
strong. They stormed the
Guild mansion![BRK]

[POR07]
Oh no...mother! We've got
to get over there!


[END]

=== 6 | d2b2 | 2eb ===
As servants of the most high
master Borgan, we cannot
allow anyone to enter Vane.[BRK]

Borgan has decreed that no
one shall enter until he
completes his business.[BRK]

[POR07]
Well, what business is he
doing?[BRK]

Number 1 or number 2?[BRK]

Get out of my way, you
morons![BRK]

[POR00]
Halt! Who are you?[BRK]

[POR07]
You don't know who I am? Now
I know you really are
simpletons![BRK]

I am Lemina, Junior Premier
of the Magic Guild of Vane![BRK]

Now, if you'll be so kind as
to get your mega-scrawny
butts out of my way...[BRK]

[POR00]
We don't care if you're
Althena herself![BRK]

Borgan has decreed that none
shall enter, and we are here
to enforce that edict.[BRK]

Step back, girl![BRK]

[POR07]
I know much more about Vane
than you ever will. I'll
find a way to get in,[BRK]

and when I do, I'm going to
make sure you're sorry,
buster![END]

=== 7 | d5a6 | fd ===
[POR07]
Hey guys, listen up. To the
east of here, there's a
transmission spring.[BRK]

If it still works, we can
use it to enter Vane behind
their backs![BRK]

C'mon, I know this is going
to work. Let's get going.[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR07]
Hiro! It's really very safe,
I promise![END]

=== 8 | d6ba | 12f ===
Halt! Step back![BRK]

By order of master Borgan,
no one is to enter Vane.[BRK]

[POR07]
By order of Lemina, I
command you to stand there
and look like dorks![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Hm! Look at that! They're
doing it! Ha ha ha![BRK]

Forget this, we can sneak in
from the transmission
spring.[BRK]

It's located to the east of
here. Let's go...[END]

=== 9 | d7fc | 10d ===
Grand master Borgan insists
that we cannot argue while
in Vane.[BRK]

He respects the sanctity and
rich tradition of this
place.[BRK]

[POR07]
Borgan is a showman and a
liar. He respects nothing
but his own belly![BRK]

If he's hurt my mother,
I'll gut him with a paper-
cutter and a spoon...[END]

=== a | d920 | 11c ===
[POR07]
And this is my home, the
mansion of the Magic Guild
of Vane.[BRK]

These walls are filled with
the history of our world.[BRK]

[POR02]
Wow...Hiro, this place is
kinda run-down, isn't it?[BRK]

I mean, look at the hole in
the roof...and over there,
that sign's broken.[BRK]

Where's bob vila when you
need him?
[END]

=== b | da50 | 9f ===
Borgan's men left here a
while ago. Lemina, you'd
better hurry to the mansion![BRK]

I'm worried about what
Borgan may have done to
your mother.[BRK]

[POR07]
I know, I know...[END]

=== c | db02 | b5 ===
Why are you staying around
the entrance area to Vane?[BRK]

Your mother Miria may be in
grave danger, Lemina! Go to
the mansion!...now![BRK]

[POR07]
Oh, yeah...right! I'll get
right over there...

[END]

=== d | dbce | 9f ===
You know, I have the utmost
respect for Lemina. She
really cares about her mom.[BRK]

She also cares a little too
much about money, but hey,
we all have our flaws...[END]

=== e | dc88 | a6 ===
Lemina, did you hear? Borgan
has kidnapped your mother![BRK]

[POR07]
Yes, I know. Don't worry,
though.[BRK]

I won't let that oversized
sloth get away with it!
Believe me, he'll pay![END]

=== f | dd4e | 9e ===
Oh, Lemina! You're having
such a bad string of luck.
Are you okay, sweetie?[BRK]

[POR07]
Don't worry about me. I can
take care of myself. And I
will get my mother back![END]

=== 10 | de1c | da ===
I heard you rescued your
mother! I knew you would,
Lemina![BRK]

[POR07]
Yep. I never really doubted
it myself! It was a pretty
hair-raising experience...[BRK]

Say, I wonder if I can sell
the rights to a made-for-
tv movie...hmmm...

[END]

=== 11 | df0a | b4 ===
You'd better not leave the
confines of Vane.[BRK]

Ever since Zophar revived, 
monsters have become more
violent and plentiful.[BRK]

That's why we installed the
barricade...to keep them
out.
[END]

=== 12 | dfd2 | 9e ===
I'm so proud of all of you!
I didn't think you had it in
you to beat Zophar![BRK]

All the inhabitants of Vane
are thinking about throwing
a parade in your honor...[END]

=== 13 | e080 | 6f ===
Since Lemina helped destroy
Zophar, Vane is known as the
city that saved the world![BRK]

I'm so proud I could burst![END]

=== 14 | e0fe | 10b ===
Uh, hey, Lemina! I tried the
Magic of Blaze again, but
I still can't get it right.[BRK]

Isn't there an easier magic
I can start with?[BRK]

[POR07]
Nope, sorry, kiddo. If you
can't manage the Magic of
Blaze,[BRK]

you're probably not cut out
for magic. Why not try a
paper route instead?

[END]

=== 15 | e224 | 1af ===
I'm gonna grow up and
protect the Magic Guild
from bad people.[BRK]

Wherever there is a cry
for help, I'll be there.[BRK]

When a woman sheds a tear in
silent fear, I'll be there.[BRK]

When one refuses to leggo
another's eggo, I'll be
there.[BRK]

[POR07]
Hold the fantasy, kiddo.
You can't do any of that
until you learn some magic.[BRK]

And you can't even master
the Magic of Blaze yet![BRK]

I'd suggest hitting the
books before you turn the
fantasy dial any higher.[END]

=== 16 | e3f2 | f1 ===
I'll never give up! I don't
care if it takes me until
the end of time.[BRK]

I will master the Magic of
Blaze![BRK]

[POR07]
That's the spirit, kid![BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, just between you and me,
you think the kid'll ever
get it right?[BRK]

[POR07]
Not a chance...[BRK]

[POR02]
Poor bastard...[END]

=== 17 | e4fe | a8 ===
I feel so bad. I'm of no use
to you if I don't know any
magic...[BRK]

[POR07]
Well, just keep trying.
You'll get it someday...[BRK]

[POR02]
You gotta give the kid
credit for not giving up![END]

=== 18 | e5c6 | 3e ===
I don't care what the others
say, I will master magic
someday![END]

=== 19 | e618 | 3e ===
One day, I'll be a great
magician, and Lemina will
be my wife![END]

=== 1a | e66e | 74 ===
I think the girl named Lucia
has collected the magic
power of our world.[BRK]

Please, tell me...what will
she do with it?[END]

=== 1b | e6fe | 43 ===
Now that Lucia's magic power
was captured, what are we
going to do?[END]

=== 1c | e758 | 49 ===
What happened to Lemina?
C'mon, man, spit it out!
I love her, dammit!



[END]

=== 1d | e7bc | b7 ===
I'm going to do my best not
to let Lemina down. I love
her, after all.[BRK]

When I grow up, I'm gonna
marry her...[BRK]

Sure, she'll be an old bag
by the time I'm in my 30s,
but what the heck!
[END]

=== 1e | e88a | c8 ===
Lemina, give it to me
straight. Do we stand a
chance against Zophar?[BRK]

[POR07]
You don't stand a chance
against a stiff breeze,[BRK]

but yes, I think my party
stands a chance of defeating
that little turd Zophar.[END]

=== 1f | e96e | eb ===
Please tell me we're not
going to lose our fight
against Zophar...[BRK]

[POR07]
If we start thinking that
loss is a possibility, then
it will become a reality.[BRK]

You've got to keep a
positive attitude, kiddo![BRK]

[POR00]
Positive attitude...right!
Got it!
[END]

=== 20 | ea6c | b5 ===
Whoo hoo! I knew that Lemina
would win! I just kept a
positive attitude![BRK]

And I only had to sacrifice
10 barneys on the burning
altar of rage![BRK]

That was definitely purple
well-spent!
[END]

=== 21 | eb34 | 3d ===
Hey! Hey! There's a party in
my pants and everyone's
invited![END]

=== 22 | eb84 | b2 ===
I gave up trying to learn
magic. I just don't think
I have an aptitude for it.[BRK]

I'll still help restore Vane
to its former glory, though.[BRK]

[POR07]
Thanks, kiddo. That means a
lot to me.[END]

=== 23 | ec46 | 20e ===
Why do you keep trying to
return Vane to its former
glory? It'll never happen![BRK]

You're bound to end up just
like general Leo, scrubbing
toilets for a living![BRK]

[POR07]
Silly! Lord Leo doesn't
scrub toilets! What are you
on?[BRK]

[POR00]
I didn't say 'lord' Leo,
stupid! I said 'general'
Leo![BRK]

You know, the washed-up,
has-been entertainment
refugee...[BRK]

...with the limited and
very repetitive vocabulary?[BRK]

I think scrubbing toilets
is the perfect job for
that loser![BRK]

[POR02]
No, I think licking the age-
old muck from gutters would
be more his speed...[END]

=== 24 | ee70 | 1bb ===
Hey there, Lemina! Who are
these people you've brought
with you?[BRK]

[POR07]
Them? Oh...they're...they're
executive candidates for the
new Vane Magic Guild![BRK]

I was just showing them the
grounds and telling them of
my plans...[BRK]

They're quite interested...
and very rich![BRK]

[POR02]
Shee! Get an earful of
that...[BRK]

I think someone's earning
some serious frequent liar
mileage right now.[BRK]

Redeemable for a first-class
ticket to hell on the good-
intentions express...[END]

=== 25 | f04a | a0 ===
Somehow I just can't believe
those friends of yours are
guild material.[BRK]

They seem more like that
loser general Leo.[BRK]

You're not lying again, are
you, Lemina?



[END]

=== 26 | f0fe | 71 ===
You know, I don't know how
someone as kind and giving
as Miria...[BRK]

Had a child as unreliable
and greedy as Lemina![END]

=== 27 | f186 | 127 ===
I've heard that the girl
called Lucia is the
destroyer Althena foretold![BRK]

I heard she even tried to
steal the power of Althena
to destroy us![BRK]

But she looked so kind and
harmless. How could she be a
destroyer of worlds?[BRK]

[POR02]
She's not! There's something
bigger than you or I can see
going on here!!
[END]

=== 28 | f2c8 | c7 ===
That girl is a heartless
destroyer.[BRK]

She didn't even care about
the lives she was wiping out
by demolishing our world![BRK]

[POR02]
She's not a destroyer! She
is trying to save our world,
not finish it forever![END]

=== 29 | f3a2 | 7f ===
So, the girl was not the
destroyer after all! It was
Zophar.[BRK]

I'm just glad she was strong
enough to protect our world
from him![END]

=== 2a | f42e | 73 ===
[POR02]
Funny, you seem to have
changed your tune from the
last time we were here![BRK]

Before you wanted to string
Lucia up![END]

=== 2b | f4b4 | c7 ===
Lemina has become very busy
guiding the Magic Guild back
to prominence.[BRK]

If she keeps improvin' the
place, I might just apply.[BRK]

[POR02]
What, have they put out a
request for whiny guys who
like to complain?[END]

=== 2c | f592 | 6f ===
Hey! I think I'd be an asset
to the Guild![BRK]

I know the magic of sniffle-
stop! It's very useful in
the winter...[END]

=== 2d | f610 | a0 ===
Haayy thaar, leedle laady!
Some straange folk weer

Pooh! If you sucked a little
less sauce, you'd know that

=== 35 | fbe4 | 143 ===
Lemina, does your mother
know that you're going into
the trial cave?[BRK]

Monsters in there have
increased lately. You'd
better stay out...[BRK]

[POR07]
Stay out? Oh, pooh! I'd like
to meet the sorry monster
that tries to attack me.[BRK]

I'll give it to him....pow!
Right in the kisser![BRK]

...and you don't need to go
telling my mom where I went![END]

=== 36 | fd42 | 195 ===
Lemina, if your mother saw
you runnin' around skinnin'
your knees like a tomboy...[BRK]

I'm sure she'd be appalled!
This is not the proper
behavior for a lady.[BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! I'm trying to get this
run-down old place back in
order and save the world...[BRK]

It's not exactly the kind of
work you do in a prom dress,
ya know.[BRK]

And my mother doesn't have
to know anything about it.[BRK]

After all, I'm just trying
to help her...
[END]

=== 37 | fef6 | a3 ===
In my day a lady never would
have been seen alone in the
company of ruffians...[BRK]

[POR07]
These aren't ruffians.
They're my friends, and they
just might save your behind![END]

=== 38 | ffac | bd ===
I give Lemina a hard time,
but I know she's just trying
to revive the Guild.[BRK]

She works very hard. Some
people think she's greedy,[BRK]

but all the money she
collects goes toward
reviving Vane...[END]

=== 39 | 1007c | 98 ===
I just saw a girl and a guy
go down there...the girl was
wearing a karate suit,[BRK]

and the guy looked quite
stern. I think his name may
have been howard...[END]

=== 3a | 10128 | b0 ===
Well, Lemina, this is the
time when everything you've
learned is put to the test.[BRK]

I know you won't let us
down.[BRK]

[POR07]
Count on it. I'm ready to
show this Zophar what I'm
made of!
[END]

=== 3b | 101ec | 9a ===
I never doubted that you
would emerge victorious...
even for a second![BRK]

You kids have made me proud.
I'm especially surprised at
what Lemina accomplished!
[END]

=== 3c | 1029a | 7e ===
The more I watch that kid
grow up, the more I see of
her mother in her...[BRK]

Lemina has just grown so
much these past few months![END]

=== 3d | 1032c | cd ===
L-lemina? Are you going
on a trip? What about the
Guild?...your dream?[BRK]

[POR07]
My work is done. My mother
and Borgan will see the
dream to reality.[BRK]

I have a new dream, and the
path I must take is with
Hiro...

[END]

=== 3e | 10408 | 130 ===
Hey, heard you were going
away.[BRK]

Boy, Lemina, I'm really
gonna miss seeing you around
here.[BRK]

[POR07]
I'm going to miss being
seen.[BRK]

But it's only a temporary
thing. I'll be back soon.[BRK]

[POR02]
Sorry to rush your tearful
reunion, but don't we have
to save your mom, Lemina?[BRK]

[POR07]
Oh dear! Yes! Mother! We
have to hurry...
[END]

=== 3f | 10554 | 9d ===
I can't believe that Borgan
had the gall to kidnap Miria
right out from under us![BRK]

[POR07]
Regardless of how daring or
powerful he is, I will get
my mother back...[END]

=== 40 | 10610 | f5 ===
There must be something
Miria knows that Borgan
wants...[BRK]

[POR07]
But what could that be? She
has told me everything about
Vane...[BRK]

[POR00]
I dunno what it is. I just
know Borgan wouldn't take
her just for kicks...[BRK]

She's got to have some
secret knowledge...[END]

=== 41 | 1071c | 78 ===
Lemina is working so hard
to bring back the Guild that
I sometimes worry about her.[BRK]

She's kinda like a daughter
to me...[END]

=== 42 | 107a8 | 51 ===
I'm glad Lemina is finally
learning what the important
things in life really are.[END]

=== 43 | 10806 | 9c ===
[POR07]
Yes, I'm afraid I've learned
the value of true friend-
ship.[BRK]

It's so precious, it can't
be bought...[BRK]

I know...I know...it
sounds corny...but it's
true!

[END]

=== 44 | 108be | 96 ===
Lemina, I just can't get
over how you've matured![BRK]

If you had lost the magic
before, you would have just
given up.[BRK]

But now, you're trying to
regain it![END]

=== 45 | 10974 | 47 ===
If you're successful, the
whole world will owe you
a debt of gratitude.[END]

=== 46 | 109d2 | 75 ===
I'll be waiting right here
when you return victorious![BRK]

[POR07]
We'll be back soon, too.
Zophar's gonna be a piece of
cake.[END]

=== 47 | 10a5a | 7d ===
I believe that Lemina has
become the best candidate
for premier of Vane.[BRK]

She's proven her worth by
saving our world with you.[END]

=== 48 | 10aea | a1 ===
Hey, you're friends of
Lemina, aren't you?[BRK]

Well then, why are you
wandering around out here
looking for her?[BRK]

You should know she'd be in
the Magic Guild mansion![END]

=== 49 | 10b9e | 6a ===
Ah, Lemina! Off on another
adventure, I see![BRK]

Well, have a good time, and
try to stay out of trouble,
okay?[END]

=== 4a | 10c18 | da ===
Some strangely-dressed
people went into the Guild
mansion a while ago.[BRK]

Talk about weird! Their
leader was a jenny craig
nightmare client![BRK]

I'm from out of town...but
I sure hope all the people
here don't look like that.[END]

=== 4b | 10d0e | 185 ===
I just can't seem to find a
good return on my investment
these days...[BRK]

[POR07]
Well then, why not invest in
the future of Vane? We're
selling junk bonds![BRK]

If things work out, you can
get returns of up to 100x on
your investment![BRK]

[POR00]
Uh, it's the 'if' that
worries me.[BRK]

I had some money in orange
county, and look what
happened to it.[BRK]

No thanks. I think I'll just
keep my money in the ol'
mattress.[END]

=== 4c | 10eb2 | a0 ===
You know what this place
needs? A nice, new busty
bowl-o-rama![BRK]

100 Lanes, auto-scoring,
scantily-clad barmaids...[BRK]

Maybe that's the investment
I'm looking for...[END]

=== 4d | 10f66 | 7b ===
Boy, this town is more of a
dump than I was told.[BRK]

On second thought, I wonder
if I should invest in Vane's
future at all...[END]

=== 4e | 10ff4 | 7c ===
With monsters surrounding
this town, how can anyone
make a business work?[BRK]

I don't think I'll be
investing here anytime soon.[END]

=== 4f | 11084 | 70 ===
Say, can I have your auto-
graphs?[BRK]

The signatures of saviors
of the world will be worth
a fortune in the future![END]

=== 50 | 11108 | 8a ===
Say, can I have a few more
autographs? I've already
sold out of the first ones![BRK]

This is going great! I think
this will be my new
business![END]

=== 51 | 111aa | 45 ===
Do you have any famous
friends? I need to get some

Say there, you look like
strangers.[BRK]

Would you like to know about
the systems of magic that
the Guild defined?
[0x5]Yes, that would be great!
No, I don't have time.[END]

=== 53 | 112b8 | 1a ===
All right then, listen up.[END]

=== 54 | 112e2 | 55 ===
Whoops, wrong answer. You're
in Vane, home of the Guild.
I think you'd better listen.[END]

=== 55 | 1133a | 1b2 ===
Magic is classified into
four basic systems that
correspond to the elements.[BRK]

There's wind, fire, water,
and earth magics. Recovery
magic also exists.[BRK]

From these basic systems,
all magic is derived.[BRK]

[POR10]
Hmmm...hey, Lemina, this guy
really seems to know a lot
about magic![BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! It's all head know-
ledge. This guy doesn't even
have magic power![BRK]

He's just an egghead that
likes to listen to himself
talk.[BRK]

Isn't that right, arvin?




[END]

=== 56 | 1150c | 7c ===
The books of the library
here tell much more about
Vane and our world.[BRK]

[POR07]
Yes, yes, that's quite
obvious, now isn't it?

The ways of magic are very
deep. I need to study
harder...[END]

=== 58 | 115ee | 115 ===
In order to master the power
of Althena, all magic in
this world must be gathered.[BRK]

Because that has been done,
there is no magic left in
our world.[BRK]

And worse yet, because you
lost to Zophar, he now has
all the magic...[BRK]

...and the power of Althena.
We're doomed...doomed I say!

Whoo hooo! The world is safe
for humanity once again![END]

Oh man....if only I could
learn how to actually
perform magic![BRK]

Just reading about it is
pretty boring after awhile.[END]

[POR07]
Your dream can come true
if you want it bad enough.[BRK]

But just sitting here
whining to strangers about
it won't help one bit![END]

=== 5c | 11874 | 14c ===
I've decided to study hard
to become a top-notch
magician![BRK]

[POR02]
And if you're real good,
you might even end up in
vegas married to some guy,[BRK]

prancing around a stage
doing magic tricks with big
cats...[BRK]

And slapping your partner's
butt a lot![BRK]

...but that's only if you're
real good...[BRK]

...and learn the magic of
plastic augmentation...

Borgan appeared suddenly by
using the magic of transfer.[BRK]

It really surprised me. All
of the sudden, this huge
mass appeared behind me![BRK]

[POR07]
I can't believe he had the
nerve to transfer right into
the midst of our city![END]

=== 5e | 11ac4 | bb ===
It shocked me that Borgan
has so much power now.[BRK]

He was a piss-poor magician
in the old days of the Vane
Magic Guild.[BRK]

I wonder how he got so very
strong? Is he using the
power of Althena?[END]

=== 5f | 11b9e | 9c ===
Boy, I sure hope you can
save your mother from that
pig Borgan![BRK]

[POR07]
It should be as easy as
melting a jello mold.[BRK]

...okay, okay...[BRK]

........a big jello mold.

Man, I am so relieved that
you were able to rescue your
mother from Borgan![END]

Borgan is called 'the
black magician' and is
considered one of the four.[BRK]

But how did he get so
strong? He was a poor, weak
magician in the old days.[BRK]

Did the teachings of the
Magic Guild at Vane somehow
corrupt him?

Ronfar and Mauri were in the
library talking when Zophar
appeared.[BRK]

He imprisoned the girl
called Lucia and took the
power of Althena.[BRK]

Now he is omnipotent, and
he's seeking to destroy our
world![BRK]

He wants to start over and
populate Lunar with his own
followers. He's sick![END]

=== 63 | 11ec8 | 80 ===
Even though people keep
saying 'don't give up hope',
I'm losing faith.[BRK]

Oh no, I've said too much.[BRK]

[POR02]
...you haven't said enough.[END]

I'm still clinging to my
last ounce of hope for this
forsaken world...[END]

There are so many depressed
people,[BRK]

I'm thinking of starting a
suicide prevention line.
What do you think?[END]

=== 66 | 12030 | 94 ===
I learned from the battle
you fought with Zophar that
anything's possible.[BRK]

If you want it bad enough,
and try hard enough, your
dream can come true.[END]

from the very beginning,

I've come from Meribia to
see the sights here in
historic Vane.[BRK]

I was told that this place
is known for its spank-
shops.[BRK]

Would you be so kind as to
direct me to one? I've been
very bad lately.[BRK]

[POR07]
What are you, some kind of
sicko?[BRK]

Spank shops? Where did you
hear that?! I demand to
know![BRK]

Vane has never had places
like that![BRK]

[POR00]
Oooh! I just knew you were
going to say that![BRK]

I was warned that they were
very exclusive, and hard to
find![BRK]

But I'll keep looking! You
can bet on that![END]

=== 69 | 12310 | 1e4 ===
I was wrong. This place
isn't interesting, it's
plain boring.[BRK]

All that's left are cruddy,
run-down buildings with
cruddy, run-down people.[BRK]

I haven't found even one
spank shop![BRK]

Maybe I should try to get
to some place with a little
mystery, like Pentagulia![BRK]

Too bad only Althena's
servants can get in the
place![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...I wonder if they ever
need to be spanked?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I mean, I'm sure they're bad
every now and then...[BRK]

Perhaps I could get a
position there as chief
spankster![END]

=== 6a | 12508 | 101 ===
Oh my god! What is that...
that...thing! Someone said
it was a destroyer![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...say. Does it administer
spankings by any chance?[BRK]

I'm certain that any
reputable destroyer should.[BRK]

I'm really in need of one
in the worst way.[BRK]

I've been quite naughty...
[END]

=== 6b | 1261c | 80 ===
Thank goodness Zophar was
stopped. For a while there
I thought it was the end![BRK]

At least now I'll live to
see another spanking...[END]

=== 6c | 126ac | f9 ===
I finally got a good
spanking![BRK]

I just wish the guy hadn't
been a stand-up comedian.[BRK]

He called himself the
prankster spankster.[BRK]

I mean, he knew his stuff.
But I could have done
without the jokes...[BRK]

....

...I'm really quite
sensitive, you know.

Lemina! Lemina! You're back!
Show me one of your magic
tricks...please?!!![BRK]

[POR07]
Well, I have a special one
I've been saving. It'll
only cost...[BRK]

[POR02]
Don't tell me you're going
to charge a kid to see one
of your cheap tricks...[BRK]

[POR07]
...as I was about to say:
it'll only cost you a big
smile! How 'bout it?[END]

=== 6e | 128fa | d1 ===
Lemina, why are you the only
member of the Magic Guild?[BRK]

[POR07]
Hmm? Oh...oh...uh...because
qualifications are quite
strict.[BRK]

In fact, it's so strict that
no one else has qualified
to get in.[BRK]

Maybe you will someday.[END]

Lemina! Lemina! Lemina! My
mom says that if the Guild

all the people that don't

Uh, that's...
...well, you see...
er.....uh....




[END]

[POR10]
Don't worry, little girl.
Lemina won't make people
like you leave.[BRK]

[POR00]
Boy! What a relief. I don't
know magic yet, so I was
scared I'd have to leave![END]

Lemina! Lemina! Lemina! Go!
Go! Go! Yea Lemina![END]

=== 72 | 12bb8 | 123 ===
Lemina! Lemina! Lemina! Are
you sure you won't kick out
people who don't know magic?[BRK]

I mean, I'm gonna learn it,
but I don't know it yet.[BRK]

My mom says you'll change
things once the Guild is
re-established.[BRK]

[POR07]
Nonsense. I don't know where
your mother is getting these
ideas, but they're wrong![END]

Le...hey! Where's Lemina?
She's okay, isn't she?[END]

I heard that a destroyer
named Zophar will come to
Vane and wreck everything![BRK]

Is that true?[END]

[POR07]
Well, he is coming. But
I'll stop him before he even
gets close to Vane!
[END]

Lemina! Lemina! Lemina
beat that bad man Zophar![BRK]

Now, Vane will finally be
safe![END]

Good day, Lemina. Beth has
been waiting patiently for
your return.[BRK]

She wants to see a trick.[BRK]

She's been talking my ears
off about how great your
tricks are...[BRK]

[POR07]
Well, it's nice to know I
have a fan in the next
generation![END]

I wouldn't lie to beth, if
I were you...[BRK]

[POR07]

This town is a nice, quiet
place to raise a child. Beth
really likes it.[END]

=== 7a | 12ffe | 8c ===
Lemina is really knocking
herself out to restore Vane
to its former self.[BRK]

I'm afraid if she doesn't
slow down, she's gonna burn
herself out![END]

=== 7b | 1309e | 17d ===
I heard a story long ago
that said our world holds
the power to restore...[BRK]

The Blue Star. If our world
disappears, the Blue Star
will remain lifeless.[BRK]

Lucia, the guardian of the
Blue Star, will come not to
save our world, but hers.[BRK]

She must protect our world,
to ensure hers can be
restored one day...[BRK]

...well, anyway, that's the
gist of the legend. I don't
remember it too well...[END]

=== 7c | 1322e | 52 ===
It's a good thing we humans
don't give up hope until the
there is none to grasp...[END]

=== 7d | 13290 | 9f ===
Now that the outside world
has returned to peace, I can
take Beth out again.[BRK]

I was so worried there for a
while that the world would
never be peaceful again...[END]

=== 7e | 1333e | e3 ===
History speaks of a time
when Vane flowed with magic
and floated in the skies.[BRK]

Nowadays, there's nothing
left around here to remind
us of that time...[BRK]

...'cept maybe the books
in the library, but those
things are fallin' apart![END]

=== 7f | 13438 | 95 ===
If you want to know about
the history of the Magic
Guild, go to the library.[BRK]

It's filled with books that
tell the history of this
city and our world.[END]

=== 80 | 134da | 48 ===
[POR07]
Oh, yes! I have to be sure
to show my friends how to
use our library![END]

=== 81 | 1353e | 4d ===
The library here in Vane is
packed to the rafters with
books. Go take a look.[END]

=== 82 | 135a2 | 82 ===
I was told that the Goddess
Althena last took human form
a few hundred years ago,[BRK]

and that she will not do it
again. Is that true?[END]

=== 83 | 13640 | ca ===
The Goddess Althena comes
to our world as a human on
a regular basis.[BRK]

However, she will not come
to us as a human again...i
don't know why.[BRK]

There might be a book in the
library that explains it,
though.[END]

=== 84 | 1371e | de ===
My word, you all did a fine
job! The goddess herself
couldn't have done better![BRK]

Maybe it's people like you
that made the Goddess want
to come to us as a human.[BRK]

Perhaps she was impressed
by the good qualities of
humanity...[END]

=== 85 | 1380c | 40 ===
Say, if you're looking for
Lemina, she's in the Guild
mansion...[END]

=== 86 | 1385a | 6c ===
[POR07]
Ding-dong? Hello? Anyone
home? I'm not in the
mansion.[BRK]

I'm right in front of you!
Are you getting senile?[END]

=== 87 | 138d6 | c4 ===
That snake Borgan went over
to the Guild mansion and
slithered inside.[BRK]

I don't trust that pile of
putrescence! You'd better
check it out...[BRK]

[POR07]
No kidding! We're on our way
there right now, thanks![END]

=== 88 | 139b6 | 89 ===
Lemina, I hate to break this
to you, but Miria has been
captured![BRK]

[POR07]
I know that already. In
fact, I'm working on saving
her right now...[END]

=== 89 | 13a5e | 63 ===
Now that I know you're on
the case, I know everything
will work out fine.[BRK]

[POR07]
I hope you're right...[END]

=== 8a | 13ad8 | 66 ===
I'm looking forward to the
day your mother returns to
Vane.[BRK]

[POR07]
Hopefully, it won't be too
much longer.[END]

=== 8b | 13b52 | 79 ===
I sometimes wish Vane had
never been shot from the
skies.[BRK]

Those days of glory and
tradition are now gone
forever, I fear.[END]

=== 8c | 13bde | a7 ===
I've heard it said that a
girl called Lucia has the
same power as Althena.[BRK]

But little is known about
this girl except that she
has a mysterious aura...[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....

[END]

=== 8d | 13c98 | 83 ===
I can't believe that you
kids saved our world from
disaster![BRK]

Times have certainly
changed! The whole world's
bein' run by kids now![END]

=== 8e | 13d2a | 9f ===
I wish there was a factory
outlet store for depends
around here.[BRK]

I'm blazing through the
damned things so fast it's
puttin' me in the poorhouse![BRK]

Old age sucks.[END]

=== 8f | 13dd6 | d6 ===
[POR07]
Well, maybe your spirits
will lift when Vane is
flying high again![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, yeah, sure...lookin' out
the window of a flying city
will...[BRK]

...take her mind off the
fact that she's fillin'
diapers like a baby...yeah![END]

Hey there, kiddo. How's the
money collection for Vane's
future going?[BRK]

[POR07]
Sorry, no time to talk, my
mother's in big trouble![BRK]

Sorry...got to run...

[END]

=== 91 | 13f6c | 113 ===
I know how much trouble
you're having raising money
for Vane's restoration.[BRK]

Is there anything I can do 
to help?[BRK]

[POR07]
Well, you can make a hefty
donation to the cause...[BRK]

[POR02]
Or you can donate to the
'buy Lemina some manners'
fund.[BRK]

[POR07]
Manners? Oh pooh! I have
plenty of manners!
[END]

=== 92 | 1409e | 35 ===
Keep at it, Lemina! We're
all behind you 100 percent![END]

=== 93 | 140e6 | 85 ===
Vane is such a nice place to
live. I hope Lemina doesn't
mess what we have up.[BRK]

I'm not too sure about her
plan to revive the Guild...[END]

=== 94 | 1417e | 77 ===
Have you heard the rumor?
There's supposed to be a
hero here in Vane![BRK]

He's supposed to save our
world from destruction![END]

=== 95 | 14204 | c1 ===
Whenever our peace is
threatened, we need to fight
to the last to keep it![BRK]

I learned this lesson from
watching your struggle to
save our world.[BRK]

Funny that I'd have to learn
that from kids, huh?[END]

=== 96 | 142d4 | 9a ===
Vane is not a bad city, it's
just that nothing much
happens here anymore...[BRK]

I'm thinking of moving to a
big city like Meribia where
there's more going on.[END]

=== 97 | 14382 | 7a ===
I really don't want to hurt
Lemina's feelings,[BRK]

but I don't think she can
revive the Guild by herself.
It's a lost cause...[END]

=== 98 | 1440a | 2f ===
[POR07]
Pooh! I will revive the
Guild! You'll see...[END]

=== 99 | 1444c | 99 ===
Do you really think you can
fight Zophar and win? Isn't
he some sort of god?[BRK]

To even try to fight him is
a suicide mission! You're
better off not trying.[END]

=== 9a | 144f8 | 9f ===
Oh, you angels! You darling
little angels![BRK]

I can't believe that you
were able to stop Zophar![BRK]

Just think! If you had
listened to me, we'd all be
history now!

[END]

=== 9b | 145a4 | 72 ===
[POR02]
Well then, it's a good thing
we just watched your lips
flap and didn't listen.[BRK]

...like we're doing right
now...[END]

=== 9c | 1462a | d0 ===
I just have to thank you by
giving you a big, wet kiss!
<Smack>[BRK]

[POR08]

.....[BRK]

Hiro, why do I feel a strong
desire to tear this woman's
head off? It's not...[BRK]

[POR02]
It's called 'jealousy.'
You'll get used to it...[END]

=== 9d | 1470a | 73 ===
I guess Vane is not as
boring as I once thought.[BRK]

Seems like a lot of
important things have
happened here recently.
[END]

Hi, Lemina! How's the magic
Magic Guild work going?[BRK]

[POR07]
It's going pretty well. Got
any more Silver pop-tops to
donate?[END]

=== 9f | 1481e | 106 ===
Have you given any more
thought to the magic army
of Vane?[BRK]

It sounds so cool...[BRK]

[POR07]
If I can successfully revive
the Magic Guild,[BRK]

my next task will be to
bring back the magic army
and the magic band...[BRK]

And you're top of my list
to lead the army when you
grow up!
[END]

=== a0 | 14944 | 72 ===
Well, my mom says I have
flat feet, so I think the
magic army is just a dream.[BRK]

Maybe I can be in the magic
band...[END]

=== a1 | 149ca | 52 ===
A long time ago, Vane was a
happy place. I think it was
because of the magic band.[END]

=== a2 | 14a30 | db ===
Zophar used to only be a
destroyer, but now he has
Althena's power.[BRK]

That means he has the power
to destroy and to create.[BRK]

Now, he will abolish our
world and recreate it to his
desire...[BRK]

Just thinking about it
scares me![END]

=== a3 | 14b1e | 44 ===
Hip hip, hooray! You beat
Zophar the Destroyer! You
deserve a medal![END]

=== a4 | 14b72 | 5e ===
If Lemina helped to defeat
Zophar, she should be able
to revive the Guild.[BRK]

I believe in her...[END]

[POR07]
If everyone in Vane thinks
like that, the Guild will be
established in no time![END]

Hey, Lemina...who are these
people with you?[BRK]

[POR07]
These are members of my new
Magic Guild.[BRK]

[POR02]
Really? This is news to me.[END]

=== a7 | 14cd2 | 94 ===
Oh, Lemina, you must save
us from the destroyer! He
wants to wipe us out![BRK]

[POR07]
I'll allow nothing of the

to deal with me!

[END]

Lemina is such a nice girl.
I hope her mother is found
safe and sound...[END]

=== a9 | 14de6 | ca ===
You have to save us from
Zophar, Lemina. He wants to
destroy us all![BRK]

[POR07]
Not to worry. I've already
dispatched that menace...[BRK]

...with a little help from
my friends here. He won't
be bothering us anymore.[END]

=== aa | 14ec4 | 4b ===
Lemina must be mad that
Borgan floats in the skies
above Vane and laughs...[END]

It's so sad. Lemina's mother
finally comes back, and now
we're in bigger trouble![BRK]

Will these problems ever
stop coming?[END]

=== ac | 14fac | a2 ===
I think the skies are
looking brighter these days.[BRK]

Is it because Zophar has
been stopped, or is it just
my imagination?[BRK]

Oh well! I don't care...I'm
off to play...[END]

It's days like this that I'm
glad to be alive![BRK]

It just makes you appreciate
this land Althena made even
more...[END]

I'm going to the library
later to play ditch with
my friends![BRK]

[POR07]
Hey there! The library is
not a playground! Does your
mother know about this?[END]

It's fun to play at the
library because we're not
supposed to.[END]

You guys all look kind of
sad. You wanna play ditch
at the library?[END]

=== b1 | 15226 | 95 ===
I'm glad you all look happy
again.[BRK]

That destroyer called Zophar
had my mom and dad worried,
too.[BRK]

But now they're so happy
they don't fight anymore...[END]

=== b2 | 152ce | ac ===
If you go south from here,
you'll reach the port town
of Azado.[BRK]

There's supposed to be a lot
of monsters around there.[BRK]

When I get big enough, I'm
gonna be a monster hunter![END]

My friends say that Vane is
going to be destroyed with
this world. Is that true?[END]

No, no, no. Vane is going
to be here for a long, long
time...[BRK]

[POR02]
And even if it is destroyed,
it'll happen so fast, you
won't know she lied...[END]

=== b5 | 15494 | 8c ===
Frankie's dad said that the
monsters around Azado were
wiped out![BRK]

He said that Lord Leo of
Althena's Guard blew them
all away! Is that true?[END]

=== b6 | 15534 | 82 ===
Sammy said that this Ghaleon
guy is really a ghost from
the past.[BRK]

A long time ago, he held
Althena captive. Is he still
a bad man?[END]

=== b7 | 155ca | 80 ===
I heard that Zophar was the
one that revived Ghaleon.[BRK]

But if Zophar is bad, why
did Ghaleon help Vane? Isn't
he still bad, too?
[END]

=== b8 | 1565a | 55 ===
Hooray for Ghaleon! He
double-crossed that jerk
Zophar.[BRK]

He was on our side all
along![END]

=== b9 | 156c2 | 12c ===
[POR10]
Well, it was quite an
adventure, wasn't it?[BRK]

Just think, if I hadn't
met you in the forest that
day,[BRK]

I never would have learned
what I'm really made of.[BRK]

Hiro, you helped me discover
the best part of myself: my
strength and inner resolve.[BRK]

I'm going back to being a
dancer, but I'll never
forget you.[END]

=== ba | 15802 | e8 ===
[POR10]
Say, Lucia, you've got
yourself quite a catch
there! I envy you...[BRK]

[POR08]
I...[BRK]

[POR10]
Ah-ah-ah! Don't even try
to make me feel better. We
all know he's the best![BRK]

Anyway, I'm headed back to
the carnival. Promise me
you'll stop by soon!

[POR14]
Hiro, listen carefully...
you cannot defeat Zophar.[BRK]

He has completed his trans-
formation using the power
of Althena.[BRK]

He is now almost completely
impervious to any attacks
you might use...[BRK]

He has but one weakness,
and that is...[BRK]

......Lucia![END]

=== bc | 159fa | f3 ===
[POR14]
Without stripping Zophar of
the power of Althena, he
cannot be defeated.[BRK]

And that power can only be
cut off by attacking what
you hold most dear...Lucia.[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR14]
Hiro, you must destroy Lucia
to save your world. It is
the only way!
[END]

[0x5]Are you serious, Ghaleon? 
No! I'll find another way![END]

=== be | 15b36 | 120 ===

Ghaleon?! You can't be
serious! I can't believe
you'd suggest such a thing![BRK]

[POR14]
I am only imparting to you
the facts as I know them.[BRK]

Remember, I was closer to
Zophar than any other human.
I know his weakness.[BRK]

...and her name is Lucia.
Only by destroying her can
you hope to defeat him.
[END]

=== bf | 15c6c | 147 ===
[POR01]
There must be another way
to defeat Zophar![BRK]

I will not sacrifice Lucia
to save the world I love.[BRK]

[POR14]
....
.....[BRK]

So be it.[BRK]

You have chosen a dangerous
path, young Hiro.[BRK]

And now, you will have no
chance of defeating Zophar.[BRK]

I would not be so daring.[BRK]

Are you prepared to bear the
blood of an entire world for
this girl you love?[END]

=== c0 | 15dec | 212 ===
[POR11]
Well, I guess Hiro made
good on his word! Hrmph!
Maybe he's not so bad...[BRK]

...at least peace has come
back to our world for a 
while.[BRK]

Now I guess it's time to
jam.[BRK]

Say, Ruby, why don't you
come to Taben's Peak with
me?![BRK]

[POR02]
Taben's peak? You mean you
want me to hang out with
the lostest boys?[BRK]

[POR11]
Sure, why not? You're free
now...you'd fit right in!
But I'm not forcing you...[BRK]

[POR02]
No...no, I want to go.
...sounds like a lot of
fun.[BRK]

Hey, Hiro, is it okay if
I head to Taben's Peak with
Nall?[BRK]

I promise I'll come visit
you soon...
[END]

=== c1 | 16002 | 28 ===
[0x5]Of course, Ruby!
Maybe some other time.[END]

=== c2 | 1603a | 5e ===

Well then, I guess I'm off
to Taben's Peak![BRK]

I promise I'll come back
to see you soon, Hiro![END]

=== c3 | 160a8 | e6 ===
[POR11]
We're going to have a blast
together, Ruby![BRK]

Just wait 'til the lostest
boys find out you've come
to play![BRK]

...oh, and Hiro, I have this
for you. Read it. You might
find it interesting.[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR00]
[0xB][0][0x10]Hiro received a letter.[END]

=== c4 | 16198 | 3c9 ===
Dear Hiro,[BRK]

although once I was known as
the Goddess Althena, I am
now Luna,[BRK]

and I shall remain so. I
have chosen happiness and
love as a human. A mortal.[BRK]

As such, I will not be able
to tell you this in person.[BRK]

I have seen your coming, but
my life will end long before
you are even born.[BRK]

I have but one regret, and
you can correct it...for the
sake of true love.[BRK]

...Lucia.[BRK]

Lucia is left to protect the
Blue Star. Living not for
herself, but for others.[BRK]

She waits silently for the
Blue Star to revive, and
now, she waits alone.[BRK]

I wanted to teach her all
about human warmth, love,
and kindness...[BRK]

But that chance has now
slipped beyond my grasp.[BRK]

Hiro, you must free her from
servitude and loneliness on
the Blue Star. For me...[BRK]

            ...and for love.[BRK]

  ...the way is open to you.

                        Luna[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR11]
Well buddy, what are you
waiting for? This is it!
Show time![BRK]

Lucia's right here! I saw
her goin' in to the Guild
mansion. Go for it, guy!

[END]

=== c5 | 16576 | ae ===
[POR02]
Sorry, Nall, Hiro said maybe
later. I'll have to pass.[BRK]

[POR11]
What? Hiro? Why is he
runnin' your show?[BRK]

You're a fully trained and
powerful Red Dragon! Think
for yourself!




[END]

=== c6 | 16640 | 99 ===
[POR11]
C'mon, Ruby! If you don't
come with me, the lostest
boys'll be bummed![BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, gee, Nall, maybe I can
ask Hiro again. Hiro, can
I please go with Nall?
[END]

=== c7 | 166f0 | d8 ===
[POR11]
Say, I saw Lucia go into 
the Guild mansion.[BRK]

This is your chance at true
love, buddy![BRK]

Go get the poor girl and
sweep her off her feet![BRK]

Don't worry about Ruby, she
and I'll have a kickin'
time. Just go get Lucia...[END]

=== c8 | 167dc | 129 ===
[POR11]
Althena chose to live life
in happiness as a human
named Luna.[BRK]

She even found true love and
happiness with Dragonmaster
Alex.[BRK]

[POR08]
I have seen the strength and
joy of humanity. I want to
see so much more.[BRK]

Maybe Althena had the right
idea...human...hmmm...[BRK]

....oh....
.........who am I kidding?


[END]

=== c9 | 16918 | 48 ===
[POR02]
Hiro! Have you changed your
mind about letting me go to
Taben's Peak?[END]

=== ca | 16992 | 119 ===
[POR05]
Hey, ya know what? I just
thought of something...[BRK]

I think that defeating
Zophar has made me the
world's first playboy/hero![BRK]

Pretty funny, huh? One of
the saviors of the world, 
and I have a major vice! Ha![BRK]

Well, anyway, I guess we
have to part ways here. Stay
in touch, you two![END]

=== cb | 16abe | 85 ===
[POR05]
Well, chief, about all I
have left to say to you is
'take care.'[BRK]

And Lucia...get this boy
some decent clothes, ok?[BRK]

See ya 'round!
[END]

=== cc | 16b56 | cc ===
[POR07]
Hmm! What good is a premier
of the Guild with no magic
power?[BRK]

That's like a wallet with
no money. Oh, this will
never do...[BRK]

I've got to concentrate and
get back my magic power![BRK]

Eeeee.....iiiiii.....ha![END]

=== cd | 16c3e | 12f ===
[POR07]
Why does Lucia need to take
all the magic power for
herself?[BRK]

Can't she leave some for me?[BRK]

After all, it is the nice
thing to do, and I am in
such a bind![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR07]
Oh well, sorry to talk your
ear off with complaints,
Hiro...[BRK]

Guess I'll just have to
work extra hard to drum up
some magic, huh?
[END]

=== ce | 16d88 | b3 ===
[POR07]
Hiro, I'm doing my best to
regain my magic ability.[BRK]

I hope you can get Lucia
back from Zophar in one
piece![BRK]

I've got to get back to
practicing...eeeee......
....iiiiii.....ha!![END]

=== cf | 16e4e | 84 ===
[POR07]
Coming back home like this
is almost like a dream or
something.[BRK]

Well, now that I am back,
I'll show my pride and power
every day![END]

=== d0 | 16ee6 | c7 ===
[POR07]
Lucia...and Hiro, I will
never forget the adventure
we had together.[BRK]

When you two are in the
area, don't forget to stop
by Vane and say hello.[BRK]

Remember, you're honorary
members of the Guild now!

[END]

=== d1 | 16fc0 | 107 ===
[POR09]
We've been through a lot,
you and I.[BRK]

And I'll tell you, Hiro,
even when I was trying to
capture you, I liked you.[BRK]

You carry with you a sense
of justice...of power.[BRK]

When we first met, I had
lost my sense of justice.[BRK]

You helped me find it again.[BRK]

Thank you, Hiro.[END]

=== d2 | 170da | 148 ===
[POR09]
The regret I feel over the
course I took in the past
is immeasurable.[BRK]

If I had come to my senses
just a bit earlier,[BRK]

I would not have put you
in this terrible situation,
Lucia.[BRK]

Know that I'm sorry, and
that I pray you can revive
the Blue Star.[BRK]

[POR08]
Knowing what you were, your
words mean so much more to
me now. Thank you, Leo.[END]

=== d3 | 17236 | 69 ===
[POR07]
Now you wait just a minute,
Hiro![BRK]

These treasures are mine!
You can't open them without
my permission![END]

=== d4 | 172b2 | 36 ===
[POR02]
Hiro, if you open those,
Lemina is going to be mad![END]

=== d5 | 17308 | 68 ===
[POR07]
Hiro! What are you doing?[BRK]

No one is supposed to open
those without my permission!
Get away from them![END]

=== d6 | 17384 | 69 ===
[POR02]
I wouldn't do that if I
were you. Those are Lemina's
treasures.[BRK]

If you open them, she's
gonna be mad!
[END]

Vane[END]

=== d8 | 1b28e | 12d ===
[POR07]
In order to beat Borgan and
see my mother back safe, we
need the right tools.[BRK]

I'd better open the
treasures of Vane so we
can use them.[BRK]

I think I can work out a
good deal on the rental
of them...[BRK]

...oh, what the heck! I'll
let you guys use them for
free...[BRK]

...after all, you are
rescuing my mother.[END]

=== d9 | 1b3d2 | 7d ===
[POR22]
Ah, Borgan, to what do we
owe the pleasure of this
visit?[BRK]

[POR17]
Miria, you are the picture
of mannerly perfection, as
always.[END]

=== da | 1b458 | 1fa ===
[POR17]
Vane has fallen into decline
since the Guild fell apart.
You know it's true.[BRK]

Now, simple people who know
nothing of the way of magic
roam its streets.[BRK]

Disgrace and despair are all
that are left for Vane.[BRK]

[POR22]
Then why have you come to
this place you hold in such
low esteem?[BRK]

[POR17]
Ah, Miria, you never were
one to skirt the issue.[BRK]

So then, I'll get to the
point. I have a selfish
reason for coming here.[BRK]

Now that this town no longer
suits a woman of your
stature,[BRK]

I have come to take you with
me to Neo-Vane.[END]

=== db | 1b65c | 62 ===
[POR07]
Oughh! That flying cesspool
has no right to come in here
like he owns the place![BRK]

I'll show him![END]

=== dc | 1b6d2 | 11e ===
[POR22]
Lemina, my dear, you've
returned![BRK]

And you've brought some new
friends with you. Introduce
me, won't you?[BRK]

[POR07]
These are not just friends
of mine,[BRK]

they're candidates to become
members of the new Magic
Guild.[BRK]

I'm gathering new candidates
every day. I will revive the
Guild some day soon![END]

=== dd | 1b81a | 40 ===
[POR22]
That's nice, dear. By the
way, this is Borgan, from
Neo-Vane.[END]

=== de | 1b85e | 166 ===
[POR22]
Borgan is one of the Four
Heroes of Althena.[BRK]

He worked very hard and
became the leader of Neo-
Vane.[BRK]

[POR07]
So?[BRK]

Everyone knows that Neo-
Vane is a pale imitation of
the original.[BRK]

Why are you so nice to him,
mother? Before, you were...[BRK]

[POR22]
Lemina! Mind your manners!
Borgan is a very powerful
man.[BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! I don't understand
you, mother. He's just
trying to...[END]

=== df | 1b9e4 | 10a ===
[POR22]
Lemina, you will treat
Borgan with respect while
he is here.[BRK]

[POR07]
But mother! He's trying to
make sure Vane's Magic Guild
never comes back![BRK]

Can't you see that?[BRK]

[POR22]
Lemina, as my daughter, you
must obey my wishes. [BRK]

Now, leave us. We have
important matters to
discuss.[END]

=== e0 | 1bb0e | 98 ===
[POR22]
Lemina, watch your tongue!
Guests in our house are to
be treated with respect![BRK]

Please take your friends and
go. Borgan and I have
matters to discuss.[END]

=== e1 | 1bbca | 219 ===
[POR22]
Hiro, come closer...I have
an urgent request to make
of you.[BRK]

[POR01]
.....
......[BRK]

[POR22]
Please, go find my daughter
Lemina.[BRK]

She's such an impulsive
girl.[BRK]

I know that she'd like
Borgan, if she'd just get
to know him.[BRK]

[POR02]
But that floating dump
is a loser! I know it![BRK]

Just say 'no.'[BRK]

[POR22]
You don't understand. Borgan
has a heart of gold.[BRK]

He's just not very good
at relating to others.[BRK]

Please, just find Lemina and
let her know I'll be fine.[BRK]

Once you find her, please
come back and let me know
she understands...[BRK]

I don't want to worry
about her...
[END]

=== e2 | 1be0a | 95 ===
[POR22]
Hiro! What are you doing
back here? You didn't find
my daughter, did you?![BRK]

Please! You must find Lemina
and explain that I'll be
fine with Borgan.[END]

=== e3 | 1bebe | ac ===
[POR22]
Hiro, I thought you were a
bright boy!?! What are you
doing back here?[BRK]

I need you to get my message
to Lemina.[BRK]

Please find her and explain
that I'll be okay with
Borgan.[END]

=== e4 | 1bf8a | 28e ===
[POR22]
Now that you've seen Lemina
and the others, you know
they have the will to fight.[BRK]

They're never going to
surrender our world to
Zophar.[BRK]

They believe in the power
of each other, and have the
will to overcome anything.[BRK]

You taught them that,
Hiro.[BRK]

[POR01]
.....!?[BRK]

[POR22]
But if you forget to believe
in yourself, Lucia truly
will be lost.[BRK]

And none of us wants to see
that...[BRK]

[POR01]
But...Miria...i...
...i...[BRK]

[POR22]
Shhh! I'm still not sure
this is the right thing
to do, [BRK]

because I was told not to
tell anyone is this, [BRK]

but I think you're just
what this person needs
right now.[BRK]

Go to the roof.[BRK]

Someone is waiting there.[BRK]

Go! Quickly, now. See for
yourself...on the roof.
[END]

=== e5 | 1c230 | 90 ===
[POR22]
Hiro, why do you hesitate?
Are you afraid of who might
be waiting for you?[BRK]

Why have you suddenly turned
afraid? Go to the roof and 
find out![END]

=== e6 | 1c2d4 | 16d ===
[POR22]
Ghaleon...that name has been
stained in blood on this
place for centuries...[BRK]

Descendants of this city
lived in shame for years
because of his actions...[BRK]

But I always felt he must
have regretted his course
after it was too late.[BRK]

I sensed a very quiet
sadness in the things he
wrote before his death.[BRK]

To have all that power, and
yet...to be lonely beyond
words...
[END]

=== e7 | 1c454 | ef ===
[POR22]
So, I was right! Ghaleon has
come back to try to right
the wrongs he committed.[BRK]

Hiro, now your task carries
even greater weight. Ghaleon
is counting on you, too.[BRK]

With Lemina at your side, I
pray you can save our world
from annihilation.[END]

=== e8 | 1c556 | 94 ===
[POR22]
In our world, the strongest
power is the power of belief
in the human spirit...[BRK]

You have proven that beyond
a shadow of a doubt.[BRK]

Well done, Hiro![END]

=== e9 | 1c5f8 | 4c ===
[POR08]
It's strange...that sounds
like something I heard a
very long time ago...[END]

=== ea | 1c658 | 6d ===
[POR22]
Well, hello there, Hiro!
Long time no see, stranger![BRK]

Have you come to see Lemina?
She's right over there.
[END]

=== eb | 1c6d4 | ad ===
[POR22]
You will reach Lucia again,
but only if you resolve
never to accept defeat.[BRK]

Try hard, Hiro. Love is
the only thing of true
worth in our world...[BRK]

[POR01]
I will never give up!![END]

=== ec | 1c7ac | 179 ===
[POR17]
Gwha ha ha ha! Ah, but I've
changed...really, I have![BRK]

And I have a very urgent
reason to be here.[BRK]

Perhaps you should catch up
on things with your mother,
dear girl.[BRK]

You may not be able to see
her for a while. She's going
on a...vacation, yes...[BRK]

It is such a pity when
people leave with issues
unresolved...[BRK]

[POR07]
What are you talking about,
Borgan? You haven't changed
a bit!

[END]

=== ed | 1c93c | 287 ===
[POR17]
It's such a shame when
places of former glory fall
into neglect...[BRK]

...I'm afraid that's what's
happened to Vane. The hand-
writing's on the walls..[BRK]

[POR07]
What? Vane is not destined
to disappear! I am working
to restore it![BRK]

[POR22]
Calm down, Lemina. Listen to
what Borgan has to say.[BRK]

You know, if you get past
the surface, he's very much
like you...[BRK]

[POR07]
Mother! How can you say such
a terrible thing?!! He's...
...he's......evil![BRK]

Why are you defending him?
He wants to kidnap you! Or
are you under his spell?[BRK]

[POR17]
Gha ha ha! I do not submit
my power for your approval,
dear girl.[BRK]

I am absolute sovereign of
my destiny now. I will do
as I wish. Behold...

[END]

Mother!!!![BRK]

[POR17]
Wasn't that delicious? And
all it took was a simple
wave of my rubenesque hands![BRK]

Poof! Mommy's gone! Gwa ha
ha ha ha![BRK]

[POR07]
Borgan! You oversized fecal
factory! What have you done
with my mother?!![BRK]

I demand that you return her
this minute![BRK]

[POR17]
Gwa ha ha ha! And I demand
that you think before you
speak, dear girl.[BRK]

Think of the power I hold.
I could crush you like a
twinkie.[BRK]

No, your mother will not be
coming back. She will rule
with me...in Neo-Vane![BRK]

And, oh...if you feel the
need to visit, please stop
by Pentagulia...[BRK]

I have a summer cottage
there Miria might enjoy.[BRK]

We'll be certain to roll out
the...dead carpet for you...
gwa ha ha ha ha...[BRK]

[POR07]
No! Borgan! I'm serious!
Come back here this instant!

Oh, mother! I can't believe
I let you down![BRK]

.....[BRK]

With my magic power I'm not
qualified to be a bathroom
attendant...[BRK]

...let alone premier of the
Magic Guild of Vane! Oh...[BRK]

What was I thinking?[BRK]

I can't even save the one
I love most! How can I hope
to restore a whole city?[BRK]

Oh, mother...I'm a failure!


[END]

=== f0 | 1d00c | 113 ===
[POR17]
The only real difference
between Miria and I is in
magic power.[BRK]

But you ignorant fools have
lost all your magic power![BRK]

Do you know why you lost
your magic? Hmm?[BRK]

It was because Lucia has
gained the power of Althena
to fight Zophar.[BRK]

All the world's power is at
her command.
[END]

=== f1 | 1d146 | 99 ===
[POR17]
Lucia has taken the power of
Althena to aid in her fight
against Zophar.[BRK]

Since Althena's power is the
source of this world's
power, there's none left.[END]

I once believed that magic
power was everything,[BRK]

but Miria has reminded me of
something more...important.
Gha ha ha ha ha...

I don't understand Ghaleon's
plan in the least. He
doesn't stand a chance.[BRK]

If I still had magic power,
I could help you, but...[END]

=== f4 | 1d328 | b1 ===
[POR17]
I'm pleasantly surprised at
your prowess in defeating
dark lord Ghaleon.[BRK]

Maybe you do stand a chance
against Zophar after all...[BRK]

Give it your best. I'm
counting on you now...[END]

[POR17]
Gha ha ha ha! The power of
my love for Miria is strong.[BRK]

Now that this world is at
peace, perhaps she will see
me for what I am...[BRK]

A great big, huggable sugar
daddy who's sweet on her.[END]

Ah, little Lemina, going
on a trip, I see...why...
thank you![BRK]

I just appreciate the fact
that you want to give me

I can't tell you how much
this means to me...gha ha

Don't worry, Lemina...I'll
keep an eye on...things...

Lay one hand on my mother

You'll what? Call me daddy?
Gha ha ha ha ha![BRK]

Oouuugh! Borgan! You disgust
me! Your mind is as slimy as
your skin![BRK]

I'll be back, and you had
better not have laid a
finger on my mother...[BRK]

[POR17]
Such an excitable girl. A

She probably wants to join,

That's...terrible![BRK]

Ah...I'm beginning to get

You came here to get me to

'interview with the maniac!'[END]

Uh, on second thought, why
don't you stay here and
play?[BRK]

Your parents will kill me if

Just because Zophar is

Ronfar has an...interesting
way of putting it, but what
he says is true.[BRK]

If you don't throw away your
hope at the first sign of

You must strip Zophar of his
power to crush our world![END]

I love you two more than

Look, if Zophar aces us,

So you have seen Miria?
How is she doing?[BRK]

Will she be back in our

Oh, what will we do? The
Goddess Althena never
returned from human form,[BRK]

our world from us. They say
he's unbeatable.[BRK]

How can we hope to prevail
against him? He has the
power of Althena!

Zophar was stronger than

It was the one thing he

Now that Lemina has put this

our business should really

It's in the mail, right?[END]

Please know that we're with

Lemina won't admit it, but

I mean...we have nothing to

exciting entertainment.[BRK]

Why should they visit?[END]

The last visitor we had was
a businessman from the city

But he was only here trying

We will stay in Vane and
just hope that business gets

I mean, what else can we do?
We don't have the money to

Since Lemina is one of the

My Grandpa says I can't go

Why doesn't someone just

Isn't that where bad people

Yaaa! The world is peaceful
again, so I can go out and
play with my friends![END]

I brought my grandson here
to escape the trouble they
were having in Azado.[BRK]

This town is filled with
good people that really care

I thought it would be a good
place to bring him up.[BRK]

[POR07]
Well, that's nice, but you
should be paying rent.[BRK]

My mother is too nice. She
lets people live here for
free![END]

Compared to the fear of

this place is like a dream

Oh, this is terrible, simply

I can't believe something
