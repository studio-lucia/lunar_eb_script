Hm, hm, hm...[BRK]

You have simply no chance
of defeating me, so why do
you persist?[BRK]

The magic powers of old have
died out, and there is no
hope for your world.[BRK]

Now, throw your very lives
before me that i may spare
your miserable souls...[BRK]

Or...fight me if you dare![BRK]

[POR05]
Hey, buster, you seem pretty
confident about a fight that
hasn't even begun![BRK]

[POR10]
We'd never surrender to the
likes of you! Forget about
it, ghaleon![BRK]

[POR07]
Even though i don't have my
magic to rely on, i'll still
kick your sorry butt![BRK]

[POR09]
I'll never again submit to
the powers of darkness![BRK]

I will resist you with every
fiber of my being!



[END]

=== 1 | ce86 | d6 ===
[POR02]
That's right! If we all
fight together, we can beat
ghaleon at his own game![BRK]

[POR14]
Hm, hm, hm, hm...you poor
delusional souls![BRK]

I suppose i'd be sad, if I
had a heart...[BRK]

...but i don't. Prepare
to witness my fury!

[END]

=== 2 | cf7a | 7f ===
[POR14]
Hiro, take my sword. You'll
need an advantage against
zophar...[BRK]

I pray it serves you well...[BRK]

[POR00]
[0xB][0]Kreceived ghaleon's sword.[END]

=== 3 | d002 | 57 ===
[POR14]
Though i cannot go with you,
know that i will be there in
spirit always. Good-bye...[END]

=== 4 | d0b2 | c ===
...lemina!

[END]

=== 5 | d0c8 | 1da ===
Oh, lemina! Thank althena
you've come back! We're in
big trouble!!![BRK]

[POR07]
Big trouble? What are you
talking about? Did you lose
your purse again?[BRK]

[POR00]
No. No! No!! Borgan has come
to vane![BRK]

[POR07]
Borgan? You mean...that big,
fat, evil...[BRK]

[POR00]
Yes! That borgan! He said he
wanted to talk with your
mother, miria.[BRK]

We tried to stop him and
the party of magicians he
brought,[BRK]

but they were just too
strong. They stormed the
guild mansion![BRK]

[POR07]
Oh no...mother! We've got
to get over there!


[END]

=== 6 | d2b2 | 2eb ===
As servants of the most high
master borgan, we cannot
allow anyone to enter vane.[BRK]

Borgan has decreed that no
one shall enter until he
completes his business.[BRK]

[POR07]
Well, what business is he
doing?[BRK]

Number 1 or number 2?[BRK]

Get out of my way, you
morons![BRK]

[POR00]
Halt! Who are you?[BRK]

[POR07]
You don't know who i am? Now
i know you really are
simpletons![BRK]

I am lemina, junior premier
of the magic guild of vane![BRK]

Now, if you'll be so kind as
to get your mega-scrawny
butts out of my way...[BRK]

[POR00]
We don't care if you're
althena herself![BRK]

Borgan has decreed that none
shall enter, and we are here
to enforce that edict.[BRK]

Step back, girl![BRK]

[POR07]
I know much more about vane
than you ever will. I'll
find a way to get in,[BRK]

and when i do, i'm going to
make sure you're sorry,
buster![END]

=== 7 | d5a6 | fd ===
[POR07]
Hey guys, listen up. To the
east of here, there's a
transmission spring.[BRK]

If it still works, we can
use it to enter vane behind
their backs![BRK]

C'mon, i know this is going
to work. Let's get going.[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR07]
Hiro! It's really very safe,
i promise![END]

=== 8 | d6ba | 12f ===
Halt! Step back![BRK]

By order of master borgan,
no one is to enter vane.[BRK]

[POR07]
By order of lemina, I
command you to stand there
and look like dorks![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Hm! Look at that! They're
doing it! Ha ha ha![BRK]

Forget this, we can sneak in
from the transmission
spring.[BRK]

It's located to the east of
here. Let's go...[END]

=== 9 | d7fc | 10d ===
Grand master borgan insists
that we cannot argue while
in vane.[BRK]

He respects the sanctity and
rich tradition of this
place.[BRK]

[POR07]
Borgan is a showman and a
liar. He respects nothing
but his own belly![BRK]

If he's hurt my mother,
i'll gut him with a paper-
cutter and a spoon...[END]

=== a | d920 | 11c ===
[POR07]
And this is my home, the
mansion of the magic guild
of vane.[BRK]

These walls are filled with
the history of our world.[BRK]

[POR02]
Wow...hiro, this place is
kinda run-down, isn't it?[BRK]

I mean, look at the hole in
the roof...and over there,
that sign's broken.[BRK]

Where's bob vila when you
need him?
[END]

=== b | da50 | 9f ===
Borgan's men left here a
while ago. Lemina, you'd
better hurry to the mansion![BRK]

I'm worried about what
borgan may have done to
your mother.[BRK]

[POR07]
I know, i know...[END]

=== c | db02 | b5 ===
Why are you staying around
the entrance area to vane?[BRK]

Your mother miria may be in
grave danger, lemina! Go to
the mansion!...now![BRK]

[POR07]
Oh, yeah...right! I'll get
right over there...

[END]

=== d | dbce | 9f ===
You know, i have the utmost
respect for lemina. She
really cares about her mom.[BRK]

She also cares a little too
much about money, but hey,
we all have our flaws...[END]

=== e | dc88 | a6 ===
Lemina, did you hear? Borgan
has kidnapped your mother![BRK]

[POR07]
Yes, i know. Don't worry,
though.[BRK]

I won't let that oversized
sloth get away with it!
Believe me, he'll pay![END]

=== f | dd4e | 9e ===
Oh, lemina! You're having
such a bad string of luck.
Are you okay, sweetie?[BRK]

[POR07]
Don't worry about me. I can
take care of myself. And I
will get my mother back![END]

=== 10 | de1c | da ===
I heard you rescued your
mother! I knew you would,
lemina![BRK]

[POR07]
Yep. I never really doubted
it myself! It was a pretty
hair-raising experience...[BRK]

Say, i wonder if i can sell
the rights to a made-for-
tv movie...hmmm...

[END]

=== 11 | df0a | b4 ===
You'd better not leave the
confines of vane.[BRK]

Ever since zophar revived, 
monsters have become more
violent and plentiful.[BRK]

That's why we installed the
barricade...to keep them
out.
[END]

=== 12 | dfd2 | 9e ===
I'm so proud of all of you!
I didn't think you had it in
you to beat zophar![BRK]

All the inhabitants of vane
are thinking about throwing
a parade in your honor...[END]

=== 13 | e080 | 6f ===
Since lemina helped destroy
zophar, vane is known as the
city that saved the world![BRK]

I'm so proud i could burst![END]

=== 14 | e0fe | 10b ===
Uh, hey, lemina! I tried the
magic of blaze again, but
i still can't get it right.[BRK]

Isn't there an easier magic
i can start with?[BRK]

[POR07]
Nope, sorry, kiddo. If you
can't manage the magic of
blaze,[BRK]

you're probably not cut out
for magic. Why not try a
paper route instead?

[END]

=== 15 | e224 | 1af ===
I'm gonna grow up and
protect the magic guild
from bad people.[BRK]

Wherever there is a cry
for help, i'll be there.[BRK]

When a woman sheds a tear in
silent fear, i'll be there.[BRK]

When one refuses to leggo
another's eggo, i'll be
there.[BRK]

[POR07]
Hold the fantasy, kiddo.
You can't do any of that
until you learn some magic.[BRK]

And you can't even master
the magic of blaze yet![BRK]

I'd suggest hitting the
books before you turn the
fantasy dial any higher.[END]

=== 16 | e3f2 | f1 ===
I'll never give up! I don't
care if it takes me until
the end of time.[BRK]

I will master the magic of
blaze![BRK]

[POR07]
That's the spirit, kid![BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, just between you and me,
you think the kid'll ever
get it right?[BRK]

[POR07]
Not a chance...[BRK]

[POR02]
Poor bastard...[END]

=== 17 | e4fe | a8 ===
I feel so bad. I'm of no use
to you if i don't know any
magic...[BRK]

[POR07]
Well, just keep trying.
You'll get it someday...[BRK]

[POR02]
You gotta give the kid
credit for not giving up![END]

=== 18 | e5c6 | 3e ===
I don't care what the others
say, i will master magic
someday![END]

=== 19 | e618 | 3e ===
One day, i'll be a great
magician, and lemina will
be my wife![END]

=== 1a | e66e | 74 ===
I think the girl named lucia
has collected the magic
power of our world.[BRK]

Please, tell me...what will
she do with it?[END]

=== 1b | e6fe | 43 ===
Now that lucia's magic power
was captured, what are we
going to do?[END]

=== 1c | e758 | 49 ===
What happened to lemina?
C'mon, man, spit it out!
I love her, dammit!



[END]

=== 1d | e7bc | b7 ===
I'm going to do my best not
to let lemina down. I love
her, after all.[BRK]

When i grow up, i'm gonna
marry her...[BRK]

Sure, she'll be an old bag
by the time i'm in my 30s,
but what the heck!
[END]

=== 1e | e88a | c8 ===
Lemina, give it to me
straight. Do we stand a
chance against zophar?[BRK]

[POR07]
You don't stand a chance
against a stiff breeze,[BRK]

but yes, i think my party
stands a chance of defeating
that little turd zophar.[END]

=== 1f | e96e | eb ===
Please tell me we're not
going to lose our fight
against zophar...[BRK]

[POR07]
If we start thinking that
loss is a possibility, then
it will become a reality.[BRK]

You've got to keep a
positive attitude, kiddo![BRK]

[POR00]
Positive attitude...right!
Got it!
[END]

=== 20 | ea6c | b5 ===
Whoo hoo! I knew that lemina
would win! I just kept a
positive attitude![BRK]

And i only had to sacrifice
10 barneys on the burning
altar of rage![BRK]

That was definitely purple
well-spent!
[END]

=== 21 | eb34 | 3d ===
Hey! Hey! There's a party in
my pants and everyone's
invited![END]

=== 22 | eb84 | b2 ===
I gave up trying to learn
magic. I just don't think
i have an aptitude for it.[BRK]

I'll still help restore vane
to its former glory, though.[BRK]

[POR07]
Thanks, kiddo. That means a
lot to me.[END]

=== 23 | ec46 | 20e ===
Why do you keep trying to
return vane to its former
glory? It'll never happen![BRK]

You're bound to end up just
like general leo, scrubbing
toilets for a living![BRK]

[POR07]
Silly! Lord leo doesn't
scrub toilets! What are you
on?[BRK]

[POR00]
I didn't say 'lord' leo,
stupid! I said 'general'
leo![BRK]

You know, the washed-up,
has-been entertainment
refugee...[BRK]

...with the limited and
very repetitive vocabulary?[BRK]

I think scrubbing toilets
is the perfect job for
that loser![BRK]

[POR02]
No, i think licking the age-
old muck from gutters would
be more his speed...[END]

=== 24 | ee70 | 1bb ===
Hey there, lemina! Who are
these people you've brought
with you?[BRK]

[POR07]
Them? Oh...they're...they're
executive candidates for the
new vane magic guild![BRK]

I was just showing them the
grounds and telling them of
my plans...[BRK]

They're quite interested...
and very rich![BRK]

[POR02]
Shee! Get an earful of
that...[BRK]

I think someone's earning
some serious frequent liar
mileage right now.[BRK]

Redeemable for a first-class
ticket to hell on the good-
intentions express...[END]

=== 25 | f04a | a0 ===
Somehow i just can't believe
those friends of yours are
guild material.[BRK]

They seem more like that
loser general leo.[BRK]

You're not lying again, are
you, lemina?



[END]

=== 26 | f0fe | 71 ===
You know, i don't know how
someone as kind and giving
as miria...[BRK]

Had a child as unreliable
and greedy as lemina![END]

=== 27 | f186 | 127 ===
I've heard that the girl
called lucia is the
destroyer althena foretold![BRK]

I heard she even tried to
steal the power of althena
to destroy us![BRK]

But she looked so kind and
harmless. How could she be a
destroyer of worlds?[BRK]

[POR02]
She's not! There's something
bigger than you or i can see
going on here!!
[END]

=== 28 | f2c8 | c7 ===
That girl is a heartless
destroyer.[BRK]

She didn't even care about
the lives she was wiping out
by demolishing our world![BRK]

[POR02]
She's not a destroyer! She
is trying to save our world,
not finish it forever![END]

=== 29 | f3a2 | 7f ===
So, the girl was not the
destroyer after all! It was
zophar.[BRK]

I'm just glad she was strong
enough to protect our world
from him![END]

=== 2a | f42e | 73 ===
[POR02]
Funny, you seem to have
changed your tune from the
last time we were here![BRK]

Before you wanted to string
lucia up![END]

=== 2b | f4b4 | c7 ===
Lemina has become very busy
guiding the magic guild back
to prominence.[BRK]

If she keeps improvin' the
place, i might just apply.[BRK]

[POR02]
What, have they put out a
request for whiny guys who
like to complain?[END]

=== 2c | f592 | 6f ===
Hey! I think i'd be an asset
to the guild![BRK]

I know the magic of sniffle-
stop! It's very useful in
the winter...[END]

=== 2d | f610 | a0 ===
Haayy thaar, leedle laady!
Some straange folk weer
goin' in tha guild mansion.[BRK]

I jus' thod i'd tell ya...

Pooh! If you sucked a little
less sauce, you'd know that

=== 35 | fbe4 | 143 ===
Lemina, does your mother
know that you're going into
the trial cave?[BRK]

Monsters in there have
increased lately. You'd
better stay out...[BRK]

[POR07]
Stay out? Oh, pooh! I'd like
to meet the sorry monster
that tries to attack me.[BRK]

I'll give it to him....pow!
Right in the kisser![BRK]

...and you don't need to go
telling my mom where i went![END]

=== 36 | fd42 | 195 ===
Lemina, if your mother saw
you runnin' around skinnin'
your knees like a tomboy...[BRK]

I'm sure she'd be appalled!
This is not the proper
behavior for a lady.[BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! I'm trying to get this
run-down old place back in
order and save the world...[BRK]

It's not exactly the kind of
work you do in a prom dress,
ya know.[BRK]

And my mother doesn't have
to know anything about it.[BRK]

After all, i'm just trying
to help her...
[END]

=== 37 | fef6 | a3 ===
In my day a lady never would
have been seen alone in the
company of ruffians...[BRK]

[POR07]
These aren't ruffians.
They're my friends, and they
just might save your behind![END]

=== 38 | ffac | bd ===
I give lemina a hard time,
but i know she's just trying
to revive the guild.[BRK]

She works very hard. Some
people think she's greedy,[BRK]

but all the money she
collects goes toward
reviving vane...[END]

=== 39 | 1007c | 98 ===
I just saw a girl and a guy
go down there...the girl was
wearing a karate suit,[BRK]

and the guy looked quite
stern. I think his name may
have been howard...[END]

=== 3a | 10128 | b0 ===
Well, lemina, this is the
time when everything you've
learned is put to the test.[BRK]

I know you won't let us
down.[BRK]

[POR07]
Count on it. I'm ready to
show this zophar what i'm
made of!
[END]

=== 3b | 101ec | 9a ===
I never doubted that you
would emerge victorious...
even for a second![BRK]

You kids have made me proud.
I'm especially surprised at
what lemina accomplished!
[END]

=== 3c | 1029a | 7e ===
The more i watch that kid
grow up, the more i see of
her mother in her...[BRK]

Lemina has just grown so
much these past few months![END]

=== 3d | 1032c | cd ===
L-lemina? Are you going
on a trip? What about the
guild?...your dream?[BRK]

[POR07]
My work is done. My mother
and borgan will see the
dream to reality.[BRK]

I have a new dream, and the
path i must take is with
hiro...

[END]

=== 3e | 10408 | 130 ===
Hey, heard you were going
away.[BRK]

Boy, lemina, i'm really
gonna miss seeing you around
here.[BRK]

[POR07]
I'm going to miss being
seen.[BRK]

But it's only a temporary
thing. I'll be back soon.[BRK]

[POR02]
Sorry to rush your tearful
reunion, but don't we have
to save your mom, lemina?[BRK]

[POR07]
Oh dear! Yes! Mother! We
have to hurry...
[END]

=== 3f | 10554 | 9d ===
I can't believe that borgan
had the gall to kidnap miria
right out from under us![BRK]

[POR07]
Regardless of how daring or
powerful he is, i will get
my mother back...[END]

=== 40 | 10610 | f5 ===
There must be something
miria knows that borgan
wants...[BRK]

[POR07]
But what could that be? She
has told me everything about
vane...[BRK]

[POR00]
I dunno what it is. I just
know borgan wouldn't take
her just for kicks...[BRK]

She's got to have some
secret knowledge...[END]

=== 41 | 1071c | 78 ===
Lemina is working so hard
to bring back the guild that
i sometimes worry about her.[BRK]

She's kinda like a daughter
to me...[END]

=== 42 | 107a8 | 51 ===
I'm glad lemina is finally
learning what the important
things in life really are.[END]

=== 43 | 10806 | 9c ===
[POR07]
Yes, i'm afraid i've learned
the value of true friend-
ship.[BRK]

It's so precious, it can't
be bought...[BRK]

I know...i know...it
sounds corny...but it's
true!

[END]

=== 44 | 108be | 96 ===
Lemina, i just can't get
over how you've matured![BRK]

If you had lost the magic
before, you would have just
given up.[BRK]

But now, you're trying to
regain it![END]

=== 45 | 10974 | 47 ===
If you're successful, the
whole world will owe you
a debt of gratitude.[END]

=== 46 | 109d2 | 75 ===
I'll be waiting right here
when you return victorious![BRK]

[POR07]
We'll be back soon, too.
Zophar's gonna be a piece of
cake.[END]

=== 47 | 10a5a | 7d ===
I believe that lemina has
become the best candidate
for premier of vane.[BRK]

She's proven her worth by
saving our world with you.[END]

=== 48 | 10aea | a1 ===
Hey, you're friends of
lemina, aren't you?[BRK]

Well then, why are you
wandering around out here
looking for her?[BRK]

You should know she'd be in
the magic guild mansion![END]

=== 49 | 10b9e | 6a ===
Ah, lemina! Off on another
adventure, i see![BRK]

Well, have a good time, and
try to stay out of trouble,
okay?[END]

=== 4a | 10c18 | da ===
Some strangely-dressed
people went into the guild
mansion a while ago.[BRK]

Talk about weird! Their
leader was a jenny craig
nightmare client![BRK]

I'm from out of town...but
i sure hope all the people
here don't look like that.[END]

=== 4b | 10d0e | 185 ===
I just can't seem to find a
good return on my investment
these days...[BRK]

[POR07]
Well then, why not invest in
the future of vane? We're
selling junk bonds![BRK]

If things work out, you can
get returns of up to 100x on
your investment![BRK]

[POR00]
Uh, it's the 'if' that
worries me.[BRK]

I had some money in orange
county, and look what
happened to it.[BRK]

No thanks. I think i'll just
keep my money in the ol'
mattress.[END]

=== 4c | 10eb2 | a0 ===
You know what this place
needs? A nice, new busty
bowl-o-rama![BRK]

100 Lanes, auto-scoring,
scantily-clad barmaids...[BRK]

Maybe that's the investment
i'm looking for...[END]

=== 4d | 10f66 | 7b ===
Boy, this town is more of a
dump than i was told.[BRK]

On second thought, i wonder
if i should invest in vane's
future at all...[END]

=== 4e | 10ff4 | 7c ===
With monsters surrounding
this town, how can anyone
make a business work?[BRK]

I don't think i'll be
investing here anytime soon.[END]

=== 4f | 11084 | 70 ===
Say, can i have your auto-
graphs?[BRK]

The signatures of saviors
of the world will be worth
a fortune in the future![END]

=== 50 | 11108 | 8a ===
Say, can i have a few more
autographs? I've already
sold out of the first ones![BRK]

This is going great! I think
this will be my new
business![END]

=== 51 | 111aa | 45 ===
Do you have any famous
friends? I need to get some
more autographs...[END]

=== 52 | 1120a | 9f ===
Say there, you look like
strangers.[BRK]

Would you like to know about
the systems of magic that
the guild defined?
[0x5]Yes, that would be great!
No, i don't have time.[END]

=== 53 | 112b8 | 1a ===
All right then, listen up.[END]

=== 54 | 112e2 | 55 ===
Whoops, wrong answer. You're
in vane, home of the guild.
I think you'd better listen.[END]

=== 55 | 1133a | 1b2 ===
Magic is classified into
four basic systems that
correspond to the elements.[BRK]

There's wind, fire, water,
and earth magics. Recovery
magic also exists.[BRK]

From these basic systems,
all magic is derived.[BRK]

[POR10]
Hmmm...hey, lemina, this guy
really seems to know a lot
about magic![BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! It's all head know-
ledge. This guy doesn't even
have magic power![BRK]

He's just an egghead that
likes to listen to himself
talk.[BRK]

Isn't that right, arvin?




[END]

=== 56 | 1150c | 7c ===
The books of the library
here tell much more about
vane and our world.[BRK]

[POR07]
Yes, yes, that's quite
obvious, now isn't it?




[END]

=== 57 | 115a0 | 3a ===
The ways of magic are very
deep. I need to study
harder...[END]

=== 58 | 115ee | 115 ===
In order to master the power
of althena, all magic in
this world must be gathered.[BRK]

Because that has been done,
there is no magic left in
our world.[BRK]

And worse yet, because you
lost to zophar, he now has
all the magic...[BRK]

...and the power of althena.
We're doomed...doomed i say!
[END]

=== 59 | 11716 | 35 ===
Whoo hooo! The world is safe
for humanity once again![END]

=== 5a | 1175e | 73 ===
Oh man....if only i could
learn how to actually
perform magic![BRK]

Just reading about it is
pretty boring after awhile.[END]

=== 5b | 117de | 7e ===
[POR07]
Your dream can come true
if you want it bad enough.[BRK]

But just sitting here
whining to strangers about
it won't help one bit![END]

=== 5c | 11874 | 14c ===
I've decided to study hard
to become a top-notch
magician![BRK]

[POR02]
And if you're real good,
you might even end up in
vegas married to some guy,[BRK]

prancing around a stage
doing magic tricks with big
cats...[BRK]

And slapping your partner's
butt a lot![BRK]

...but that's only if you're
real good...[BRK]

...and learn the magic of
plastic augmentation...

Borgan appeared suddenly by
using the magic of transfer.[BRK]

It really surprised me. All
of the sudden, this huge
mass appeared behind me![BRK]

[POR07]
I can't believe he had the
nerve to transfer right into
the midst of our city![END]

=== 5e | 11ac4 | bb ===
It shocked me that borgan
has so much power now.[BRK]

He was a piss-poor magician
in the old days of the vane
magic guild.[BRK]

I wonder how he got so very
strong? Is he using the
power of althena?[END]

=== 5f | 11b9e | 9c ===
Boy, i sure hope you can
save your mother from that
pig borgan![BRK]

[POR07]
It should be as easy as
melting a jello mold.[BRK]

...okay, okay...[BRK]

........a big jello mold.
[END]

=== 60 | 11c52 | 4b ===
Man, i am so relieved that
you were able to rescue your
mother from borgan![END]

=== 61 | 11cb0 | d7 ===
Borgan is called 'the
black magician' and is
considered one of the four.[BRK]

But how did he get so
strong? He was a poor, weak
magician in the old days.[BRK]

Did the teachings of the
magic guild at vane somehow
corrupt him?
[END]

=== 62 | 11d9e | 10f ===
Ronfar and mauri were in the
library talking when zophar
appeared.[BRK]

He imprisoned the girl
called lucia and took the
power of althena.[BRK]

Now he is omnipotent, and
he's seeking to destroy our
world![BRK]

He wants to start over and
populate lunar with his own
followers. He's sick![END]

=== 63 | 11ec8 | 80 ===
Even though people keep
saying 'don't give up hope',
i'm losing faith.[BRK]

Oh no, i've said too much.[BRK]

[POR02]
...you haven't said enough.[END]

=== 64 | 11f5c | 46 ===
I'm still clinging to my
last ounce of hope for this
forsaken world...[END]

=== 65 | 11fb6 | 6a ===
There are so many depressed
people,[BRK]

i'm thinking of starting a
suicide prevention line.
What do you think?[END]

=== 66 | 12030 | 94 ===
I learned from the battle
you fought with zophar that
anything's possible.[BRK]

If you want it bad enough,
and try hard enough, your
dream can come true.[END]

=== 67 | 120d2 | 3c ===
[POR07]
Pooh! That's been obvious
from the very beginning,
silly![END]

I've come from meribia to
see the sights here in
historic vane.[BRK]

I was told that this place
is known for its spank-
shops.[BRK]

Would you be so kind as to
direct me to one? I've been
very bad lately.[BRK]

[POR07]
What are you, some kind of
sicko?[BRK]

Spank shops? Where did you
hear that?! I demand to
know![BRK]

Vane has never had places
like that![BRK]

[POR00]
Oooh! I just knew you were
going to say that![BRK]

I was warned that they were
very exclusive, and hard to
find![BRK]

But i'll keep looking! You
can bet on that![END]

=== 69 | 12310 | 1e4 ===
I was wrong. This place
isn't interesting, it's
plain boring.[BRK]

All that's left are cruddy,
run-down buildings with
cruddy, run-down people.[BRK]

I haven't found even one
spank shop![BRK]

Maybe i should try to get
to some place with a little
mystery, like pentagulia![BRK]

Too bad only althena's
servants can get in the
place![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...i wonder if they ever
need to be spanked?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I mean, i'm sure they're bad
every now and then...[BRK]

Perhaps i could get a
position there as chief
spankster![END]

=== 6a | 12508 | 101 ===
Oh my god! What is that...
that...thing! Someone said
it was a destroyer![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...say. Does it administer
spankings by any chance?[BRK]

I'm certain that any
reputable destroyer should.[BRK]

I'm really in need of one
in the worst way.[BRK]

I've been quite naughty...
[END]

=== 6b | 1261c | 80 ===
Thank goodness zophar was
stopped. For a while there
i thought it was the end![BRK]

At least now i'll live to
see another spanking...[END]

=== 6c | 126ac | f9 ===
I finally got a good
spanking![BRK]

I just wish the guy hadn't
been a stand-up comedian.[BRK]

He called himself the
prankster spankster.[BRK]

I mean, he knew his stuff.
But i could have done
without the jokes...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...i'm really quite
sensitive, you know.
[END]

=== 6d | 127b8 | 12a ===
Lemina! Lemina! You're back!
Show me one of your magic
tricks...please?!!![BRK]

[POR07]
Well, i have a special one
i've been saving. It'll
only cost...[BRK]

[POR02]
Don't tell me you're going
to charge a kid to see one
of your cheap tricks...[BRK]

[POR07]
...as i was about to say:
it'll only cost you a big
smile! How 'bout it?[END]

=== 6e | 128fa | d1 ===
Lemina, why are you the only
member of the magic guild?[BRK]

[POR07]
Hmm? Oh...oh...uh...because
qualifications are quite
strict.[BRK]

In fact, it's so strict that
no one else has qualified
to get in.[BRK]

Maybe you will someday.[END]

=== 6f | 129e6 | c8 ===
Lemina! Lemina! Lemina! My
mom says that if the guild
is re-established,[BRK]

all the people that don't 
know magic will have to
leave. Is that true?[BRK]

[POR07]
Uh, that's...
...well, you see...
er.....uh....




[END]

=== 70 | 12abc | 97 ===
[POR10]
Don't worry, little girl.
Lemina won't make people
like you leave.[BRK]

[POR00]
Boy! What a relief. I don't
know magic yet, so i was
scared i'd have to leave![END]

=== 71 | 12b72 | 2f ===
Lemina! Lemina! Lemina! Go!
Go! Go! Yea lemina![END]

=== 72 | 12bb8 | 123 ===
Lemina! Lemina! Lemina! Are
you sure you won't kick out
people who don't know magic?[BRK]

I mean, i'm gonna learn it,
but i don't know it yet.[BRK]

My mom says you'll change
things once the guild is
re-established.[BRK]

[POR07]
Nonsense. I don't know where
your mother is getting these
ideas, but they're wrong![END]

=== 73 | 12cee | 30 ===
Le...hey! Where's lemina?
She's okay, isn't she?[END]

=== 74 | 12d32 | 5b ===
I heard that a destroyer
named zophar will come to
vane and wreck everything![BRK]

Is that true?[END]

=== 75 | 12d9a | 4c ===
[POR07]
Well, he is coming. But
i'll stop him before he even
gets close to vane!
[END]

=== 76 | 12df6 | 50 ===
Lemina! Lemina! Lemina
beat that bad man zophar![BRK]

Now, vane will finally be
safe![END]

=== 77 | 12e5e | de ===
Good day, lemina. Beth has
been waiting patiently for
your return.[BRK]

She wants to see a trick.[BRK]

She's been talking my ears
off about how great your
tricks are...[BRK]

[POR07]
Well, it's nice to know I
have a fan in the next
generation![END]

=== 78 | 12f54 | 36 ===
I wouldn't lie to beth, if
i were you...[BRK]

[POR07]

This town is a nice, quiet
place to raise a child. Beth
really likes it.[END]

=== 7a | 12ffe | 8c ===
Lemina is really knocking
herself out to restore vane
to its former self.[BRK]

I'm afraid if she doesn't
slow down, she's gonna burn
herself out![END]

=== 7b | 1309e | 17d ===
I heard a story long ago
that said our world holds
the power to restore...[BRK]

The blue star. If our world
disappears, the blue star
will remain lifeless.[BRK]

Lucia, the guardian of the
blue star, will come not to
save our world, but hers.[BRK]

She must protect our world,
to ensure hers can be
restored one day...[BRK]

...well, anyway, that's the
gist of the legend. I don't
remember it too well...[END]

=== 7c | 1322e | 52 ===
It's a good thing we humans
don't give up hope until the
there is none to grasp...[END]

=== 7d | 13290 | 9f ===
Now that the outside world
has returned to peace, i can
take beth out again.[BRK]

I was so worried there for a
while that the world would
never be peaceful again...[END]

=== 7e | 1333e | e3 ===
History speaks of a time
when vane flowed with magic
and floated in the skies.[BRK]

Nowadays, there's nothing
left around here to remind
us of that time...[BRK]

...'cept maybe the books
in the library, but those
things are fallin' apart![END]

=== 7f | 13438 | 95 ===
If you want to know about
the history of the magic
guild, go to the library.[BRK]

It's filled with books that
tell the history of this
city and our world.[END]

=== 80 | 134da | 48 ===
[POR07]
Oh, yes! I have to be sure
to show my friends how to
use our library![END]

=== 81 | 1353e | 4d ===
The library here in vane is
packed to the rafters with
books. Go take a look.[END]

=== 82 | 135a2 | 82 ===
I was told that the goddess
althena last took human form
a few hundred years ago,[BRK]

and that she will not do it
again. Is that true?[END]

=== 83 | 13640 | ca ===
The goddess althena comes
to our world as a human on
a regular basis.[BRK]

However, she will not come
to us as a human again...i
don't know why.[BRK]

There might be a book in the
library that explains it,
though.[END]

=== 84 | 1371e | de ===
My word, you all did a fine
job! The goddess herself
couldn't have done better![BRK]

Maybe it's people like you
that made the goddess want
to come to us as a human.[BRK]

Perhaps she was impressed
by the good qualities of
humanity...[END]

=== 85 | 1380c | 40 ===
Say, if you're looking for
lemina, she's in the guild
mansion...[END]

=== 86 | 1385a | 6c ===
[POR07]
Ding-dong? Hello? Anyone
home? I'm not in the
mansion.[BRK]

I'm right in front of you!
Are you getting senile?[END]

=== 87 | 138d6 | c4 ===
That snake borgan went over
to the guild mansion and
slithered inside.[BRK]

I don't trust that pile of
putrescence! You'd better
check it out...[BRK]

[POR07]
No kidding! We're on our way
there right now, thanks![END]

=== 88 | 139b6 | 89 ===
Lemina, i hate to break this
to you, but miria has been
captured![BRK]

[POR07]
I know that already. In
fact, i'm working on saving
her right now...[END]

=== 89 | 13a5e | 63 ===
Now that i know you're on
the case, i know everything
will work out fine.[BRK]

[POR07]
I hope you're right...[END]

=== 8a | 13ad8 | 66 ===
I'm looking forward to the
day your mother returns to
vane.[BRK]

[POR07]
Hopefully, it won't be too
much longer.[END]

=== 8b | 13b52 | 79 ===
I sometimes wish vane had
never been shot from the
skies.[BRK]

Those days of glory and
tradition are now gone
forever, i fear.[END]

=== 8c | 13bde | a7 ===
I've heard it said that a
girl called lucia has the
same power as althena.[BRK]

But little is known about
this girl except that she
has a mysterious aura...[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....

[END]

=== 8d | 13c98 | 83 ===
I can't believe that you
kids saved our world from
disaster![BRK]

Times have certainly
changed! The whole world's
bein' run by kids now![END]

=== 8e | 13d2a | 9f ===
I wish there was a factory
outlet store for depends
around here.[BRK]

I'm blazing through the
damned things so fast it's
puttin' me in the poorhouse![BRK]

Old age sucks.[END]

=== 8f | 13dd6 | d6 ===
[POR07]
Well, maybe your spirits
will lift when vane is
flying high again![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, yeah, sure...lookin' out
the window of a flying city
will...[BRK]

...take her mind off the
fact that she's fillin'
diapers like a baby...yeah![END]

=== 90 | 13ebc | 94 ===
Hey there, kiddo. How's the
money collection for vane's
future going?[BRK]

[POR07]
Sorry, no time to talk, my
mother's in big trouble![BRK]

Sorry...got to run...

[END]

=== 91 | 13f6c | 113 ===
I know how much trouble
you're having raising money
for vane's restoration.[BRK]

Is there anything i can do 
to help?[BRK]

[POR07]
Well, you can make a hefty
donation to the cause...[BRK]

[POR02]
Or you can donate to the
'buy lemina some manners'
fund.[BRK]

[POR07]
Manners? Oh pooh! I have
plenty of manners!
[END]

=== 92 | 1409e | 35 ===
Keep at it, lemina! We're
all behind you 100 percent![END]

=== 93 | 140e6 | 85 ===
Vane is such a nice place to
live. I hope lemina doesn't
mess what we have up.[BRK]

I'm not too sure about her
plan to revive the guild...[END]

=== 94 | 1417e | 77 ===
Have you heard the rumor?
There's supposed to be a
hero here in vane![BRK]

He's supposed to save our
world from destruction![END]

=== 95 | 14204 | c1 ===
Whenever our peace is
threatened, we need to fight
to the last to keep it![BRK]

I learned this lesson from
watching your struggle to
save our world.[BRK]

Funny that i'd have to learn
that from kids, huh?[END]

=== 96 | 142d4 | 9a ===
Vane is not a bad city, it's
just that nothing much
happens here anymore...[BRK]

I'm thinking of moving to a
big city like meribia where
there's more going on.[END]

=== 97 | 14382 | 7a ===
I really don't want to hurt
lemina's feelings,[BRK]

but i don't think she can
revive the guild by herself.
It's a lost cause...[END]

=== 98 | 1440a | 2f ===
[POR07]
Pooh! I will revive the
guild! You'll see...[END]

=== 99 | 1444c | 99 ===
Do you really think you can
fight zophar and win? Isn't
he some sort of god?[BRK]

To even try to fight him is
a suicide mission! You're
better off not trying.[END]

=== 9a | 144f8 | 9f ===
Oh, you angels! You darling
little angels![BRK]

I can't believe that you
were able to stop zophar![BRK]

Just think! If you had
listened to me, we'd all be
history now!

[END]

=== 9b | 145a4 | 72 ===
[POR02]
Well then, it's a good thing
we just watched your lips
flap and didn't listen.[BRK]

...like we're doing right
now...[END]

=== 9c | 1462a | d0 ===
I just have to thank you by
giving you a big, wet kiss!
<Smack>[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

Hiro, why do i feel a strong
desire to tear this woman's
head off? It's not...[BRK]

[POR02]
It's called 'jealousy.'
You'll get used to it...[END]

=== 9d | 1470a | 73 ===
I guess vane is not as
boring as i once thought.[BRK]

Seems like a lot of
important things have
happened here recently.
[END]

Hi, lemina! How's the magic
magic guild work going?[BRK]

[POR07]
It's going pretty well. Got
any more silver pop-tops to
donate?[END]

=== 9f | 1481e | 106 ===
Have you given any more
thought to the magic army
of vane?[BRK]

It sounds so cool...[BRK]

[POR07]
If i can successfully revive
the magic guild,[BRK]

my next task will be to
bring back the magic army
and the magic band...[BRK]

And you're top of my list
to lead the army when you
grow up!
[END]

=== a0 | 14944 | 72 ===
Well, my mom says i have
flat feet, so i think the
magic army is just a dream.[BRK]

Maybe i can be in the magic
band...[END]

=== a1 | 149ca | 52 ===
A long time ago, vane was a
happy place. I think it was
because of the magic band.[END]

=== a2 | 14a30 | db ===
Zophar used to only be a
destroyer, but now he has
althena's power.[BRK]

That means he has the power
to destroy and to create.[BRK]

Now, he will abolish our
world and recreate it to his
desire...[BRK]

Just thinking about it
scares me![END]

=== a3 | 14b1e | 44 ===
Hip hip, hooray! You beat
zophar the destroyer! You
deserve a medal![END]

=== a4 | 14b72 | 5e ===
If lemina helped to defeat
zophar, she should be able
to revive the guild.[BRK]

I believe in her...[END]

=== a5 | 14bde | 52 ===
[POR07]
If everyone in vane thinks
like that, the guild will be
established in no time![END]

=== a6 | 14c40 | 77 ===
Hey, lemina...who are these
people with you?[BRK]

[POR07]
These are members of my new
magic guild.[BRK]

[POR02]
Really? This is news to me.[END]

=== a7 | 14cd2 | 94 ===
Oh, lemina, you must save
us from the destroyer! He
wants to wipe us out![BRK]

[POR07]
I'll allow nothing of the
sort to happen. Zophar has
to deal with me!

[END]

Lemina is such a nice girl.
I hope her mother is found
safe and sound...[END]

=== a9 | 14de6 | ca ===
You have to save us from
zophar, lemina. He wants to
destroy us all![BRK]

[POR07]
Not to worry. I've already
dispatched that menace...[BRK]

...with a little help from
my friends here. He won't
be bothering us anymore.[END]

=== aa | 14ec4 | 4b ===
Lemina must be mad that
borgan floats in the skies
above vane and laughs...[END]

It's so sad. Lemina's mother
finally comes back, and now
we're in bigger trouble![BRK]

Will these problems ever
stop coming?[END]

=== ac | 14fac | a2 ===
I think the skies are
looking brighter these days.[BRK]

Is it because zophar has
been stopped, or is it just
my imagination?[BRK]

Oh well! I don't care...i'm
off to play...[END]

=== ad | 1505e | 6f ===
It's days like this that i'm
glad to be alive![BRK]

It just makes you appreciate
this land althena made even
more...[END]

I'm going to the library
later to play ditch with
my friends![BRK]

[POR07]
Hey there! The library is
not a playground! Does your
mother know about this?[END]

=== af | 15182 | 3e ===
It's fun to play at the
library because we're not
supposed to.[END]

=== b0 | 151d4 | 43 ===
You guys all look kind of
sad. You wanna play ditch
at the library?[END]

=== b1 | 15226 | 95 ===
I'm glad you all look happy
again.[BRK]

That destroyer called zophar
had my mom and dad worried,
too.[BRK]

But now they're so happy
they don't fight anymore...[END]

=== b2 | 152ce | ac ===
If you go south from here,
you'll reach the port town
of azado.[BRK]

There's supposed to be a lot
of monsters around there.[BRK]

When i get big enough, i'm
gonna be a monster hunter![END]

My friends say that vane is
going to be destroyed with
this world. Is that true?[END]

No, no, no. Vane is going
to be here for a long, long
time...[BRK]

[POR02]
And even if it is destroyed,
it'll happen so fast, you
won't know she lied...[END]

=== b5 | 15494 | 8c ===
Frankie's dad said that the
monsters around azado were
wiped out![BRK]

He said that lord leo of
althena's guard blew them
all away! Is that true?[END]

=== b6 | 15534 | 82 ===
Sammy said that this ghaleon
guy is really a ghost from
the past.[BRK]

A long time ago, he held
althena captive. Is he still
a bad man?[END]

=== b7 | 155ca | 80 ===
I heard that zophar was the
one that revived ghaleon.[BRK]

But if zophar is bad, why
did ghaleon help vane? Isn't
he still bad, too?
[END]

=== b8 | 1565a | 55 ===
Hooray for ghaleon! He
double-crossed that jerk
zophar.[BRK]

He was on our side all
along![END]

=== b9 | 156c2 | 12c ===
[POR10]
Well, it was quite an
adventure, wasn't it?[BRK]

Just think, if i hadn't
met you in the forest that
day,[BRK]

i never would have learned
what i'm really made of.[BRK]

Hiro, you helped me discover
the best part of myself: my
strength and inner resolve.[BRK]

I'm going back to being a
dancer, but i'll never
forget you.[END]

=== ba | 15802 | e8 ===
[POR10]
Say, lucia, you've got
yourself quite a catch
there! I envy you...[BRK]

[POR08]
I...[BRK]

[POR10]
Ah-ah-ah! Don't even try
to make me feel better. We
all know he's the best![BRK]

Anyway, i'm headed back to
the carnival. Promise me
you'll stop by soon!

Hiro, listen carefully...
you cannot defeat zophar.[BRK]

He has completed his trans-
formation using the power
of althena.[BRK]

He is now almost completely
impervious to any attacks
you might use...[BRK]

He has but one weakness,
and that is...[BRK]

......lucia![END]

=== bc | 159fa | f3 ===
[POR14]
Without stripping zophar of
the power of althena, he
cannot be defeated.[BRK]

And that power can only be
cut off by attacking what
you hold most dear...lucia.[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR14]
Hiro, you must destroy lucia
to save your world. It is
the only way!

No! I'll find another way![END]

Ghaleon?! You can't be
serious! I can't believe
you'd suggest such a thing![BRK]

[POR14]
I am only imparting to you
the facts as i know them.[BRK]

Remember, i was closer to
zophar than any other human.
I know his weakness.[BRK]

...and her name is lucia.
Only by destroying her can
you hope to defeat him.
[END]

=== bf | 15c6c | 147 ===

There must be another way
to defeat zophar![BRK]

I will not sacrifice lucia
to save the world i love.[BRK]

So be it.[BRK]

You have chosen a dangerous
path, young hiro.[BRK]

And now, you will have no
chance of defeating zophar.[BRK]

I would not be so daring.[BRK]

Are you prepared to bear the
blood of an entire world for
this girl you love?[END]

=== c0 | 15dec | 212 ===

Well, i guess hiro made
good on his word! Hrmph!
Maybe he's not so bad...[BRK]

...at least peace has come
back to our world for a 
while.[BRK]

Now i guess it's time to
jam.[BRK]

Say, ruby, why don't you
come to taben's peak with
me?![BRK]

[POR02]
Taben's peak? You mean you
want me to hang out with
the lostest boys?[BRK]

[POR11]
Sure, why not? You're free
now...you'd fit right in!
But i'm not forcing you...[BRK]

[POR02]
No...no, i want to go.
...sounds like a lot of
fun.[BRK]

Hey, hiro, is it okay if
i head to taben's peak with
nall?[BRK]

I promise i'll come visit
you soon...

I promise i'll come back

find it interesting.[BRK]

[POR00]
[0xB][0][0x10]Hiro received a letter.[END]

=== c4 | 16198 | 3c9 ===
Dear hiro,[BRK]

although once i was known as
the goddess althena, i am
now luna,[BRK]

and i shall remain so. I
have chosen happiness and
love as a human. A mortal.[BRK]

As such, i will not be able
to tell you this in person.[BRK]

I have seen your coming, but
my life will end long before
you are even born.[BRK]

I have but one regret, and
you can correct it...for the
sake of true love.[BRK]

...lucia.[BRK]

Lucia is left to protect the
blue star. Living not for
herself, but for others.[BRK]

She waits silently for the
blue star to revive, and
now, she waits alone.[BRK]

I wanted to teach her all
about human warmth, love,
and kindness...[BRK]

But that chance has now
slipped beyond my grasp.[BRK]

Hiro, you must free her from
servitude and loneliness on
the blue star. For me...[BRK]

            ...and for love.[BRK]

  ...the way is open to you.

                        Luna[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR11]
Well buddy, what are you
waiting for? This is it!
Show time![BRK]

Lucia's right here! I saw
her goin' in to the guild
mansion. Go for it, guy!

[END]

=== c5 | 16576 | ae ===
[POR02]
Sorry, nall, hiro said maybe
later. I'll have to pass.[BRK]

runnin' your show?[BRK]

You're a fully trained and
powerful red dragon! Think
for yourself!




[END]

=== c6 | 16640 | 99 ===
[POR11]
C'mon, ruby! If you don't
come with me, the lostest
boys'll be bummed![BRK]

Uh, gee, nall, maybe i can
ask hiro again. Hiro, can
i please go with nall?
[END]

=== c7 | 166f0 | d8 ===
[POR11]
Say, i saw lucia go into 
the guild mansion.[BRK]

This is your chance at true
love, buddy![BRK]

Go get the poor girl and
sweep her off her feet![BRK]

Don't worry about ruby, she
and i'll have a kickin'
time. Just go get lucia...[END]

Althena chose to live life
in happiness as a human
named luna.[BRK]

She even found true love and
happiness with dragonmaster
alex.[BRK]

[POR08]
I have seen the strength and
joy of humanity. I want to
see so much more.[BRK]

Maybe althena had the right
idea...human...hmmm...[BRK]

mind about letting me go to
taben's peak?[END]

=== ca | 16992 | 119 ===
[POR05]
Hey, ya know what? I just
thought of something...[BRK]

I think that defeating
zophar has made me the
world's first playboy/hero![BRK]

Pretty funny, huh? One of
the saviors of the world, 
and i have a major vice! Ha![BRK]

Well, anyway, i guess we
have to part ways here. Stay
in touch, you two![END]

=== cb | 16abe | 85 ===

Well, chief, about all I

'take care.'[BRK]

some decent clothes, ok?[BRK]

See ya 'round!
[END]

=== cc | 16b56 | cc ===
[POR07]
Hmm! What good is a premier
of the guild with no magic
power?[BRK]

That's like a wallet with
no money. Oh, this will
never do...[BRK]

I've got to concentrate and
get back my magic power![BRK]

Eeeee.....iiiiii.....ha![END]

=== cd | 16c3e | 12f ===
[POR07]
Why does lucia need to take
all the magic power for
herself?[BRK]

Can't she leave some for me?[BRK]

After all, it is the nice
thing to do, and i am in
such a bind![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR07]
Oh well, sorry to talk your
ear off with complaints,
hiro...[BRK]

Guess i'll just have to
work extra hard to drum up
some magic, huh?
[END]

=== ce | 16d88 | b3 ===
[POR07]
Hiro, i'm doing my best to
regain my magic ability.[BRK]

I hope you can get lucia
back from zophar in one
piece![BRK]

I've got to get back to
practicing...eeeee......
....iiiiii.....ha!![END]

=== cf | 16e4e | 84 ===

something.[BRK]

Well, now that i am back,
i'll show my pride and power
every day![END]

=== d0 | 16ee6 | c7 ===
[POR07]
Lucia...and hiro, i will
never forget the adventure
we had together.[BRK]

When you two are in the
area, don't forget to stop
by vane and say hello.[BRK]

Remember, you're honorary
members of the guild now!

[END]

=== d1 | 16fc0 | 107 ===
[POR09]
We've been through a lot,
you and i.[BRK]

And i'll tell you, hiro,
even when i was trying to
capture you, i liked you.[BRK]

You carry with you a sense
of justice...of power.[BRK]

When we first met, i had
lost my sense of justice.[BRK]

You helped me find it again.[BRK]

Thank you, hiro.[END]

=== d2 | 170da | 148 ===
[POR09]
The regret i feel over the
course i took in the past
is immeasurable.[BRK]

If i had come to my senses
just a bit earlier,[BRK]

i would not have put you
in this terrible situation,
lucia.[BRK]

Know that i'm sorry, and
that i pray you can revive
the blue star.[BRK]

[POR08]
Knowing what you were, your
words mean so much more to
me now. Thank you, leo.[END]

Now you wait just a minute,
hiro![BRK]

These treasures are mine!
You can't open them without
my permission![END]

[POR02]
Hiro, if you open those,
lemina is going to be mad![END]

Hiro! What are you doing?[BRK]

No one is supposed to open
those without my permission!
Get away from them![END]

I wouldn't do that if I
were you. Those are lemina's

If you open them, she's
gonna be mad!

[POR07]
In order to beat borgan and
see my mother back safe, we
need the right tools.[BRK]

I'd better open the
treasures of vane so we
can use them.[BRK]

I think i can work out a
good deal on the rental
of them...[BRK]

...oh, what the heck! I'll
let you guys use them for
free...[BRK]

...after all, you are
rescuing my mother.[END]

=== d9 | 1b3d2 | 7d ===
[POR22]
Ah, borgan, to what do we
owe the pleasure of this
visit?[BRK]

[POR17]
Miria, you are the picture
of mannerly perfection, as
always.[END]

=== da | 1b458 | 1fa ===
[POR17]
Vane has fallen into decline
since the guild fell apart.
You know it's true.[BRK]

Now, simple people who know
nothing of the way of magic
roam its streets.[BRK]

Disgrace and despair are all
that are left for vane.[BRK]

[POR22]
Then why have you come to
this place you hold in such
low esteem?[BRK]

[POR17]
Ah, miria, you never were
one to skirt the issue.[BRK]

So then, i'll get to the
point. I have a selfish
reason for coming here.[BRK]

Now that this town no longer
suits a woman of your
stature,[BRK]

i have come to take you with
me to neo-vane.[END]

=== db | 1b65c | 62 ===

Oughh! That flying cesspool
has no right to come in here
like he owns the place![BRK]

I'll show him![END]

[POR22]
Lemina, my dear, you've
returned![BRK]

And you've brought some new
friends with you. Introduce
me, won't you?[BRK]

[POR07]
These are not just friends
of mine,[BRK]

they're candidates to become
members of the new magic
guild.[BRK]

I'm gathering new candidates
every day. I will revive the
guild some day soon![END]

That's nice, dear. By the
way, this is borgan, from
neo-vane.[END]

[POR22]
Borgan is one of the four
heroes of althena.[BRK]

He worked very hard and
became the leader of neo-
vane.[BRK]

[POR07]
So?[BRK]

Everyone knows that neo-
vane is a pale imitation of
the original.[BRK]

Why are you so nice to him,
mother? Before, you were...[BRK]

[POR22]
Lemina! Mind your manners!
Borgan is a very powerful
man.[BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! I don't understand
you, mother. He's just
trying to...[END]

=== df | 1b9e4 | 10a ===
[POR22]
Lemina, you will treat
borgan with respect while
he is here.[BRK]

[POR07]
But mother! He's trying to
make sure vane's magic guild
never comes back![BRK]

Can't you see that?[BRK]

[POR22]
Lemina, as my daughter, you
must obey my wishes. [BRK]

Now, leave us. We have
important matters to
discuss.[END]

=== e0 | 1bb0e | 98 ===

Lemina, watch your tongue!
Guests in our house are to
be treated with respect![BRK]

Please take your friends and

Hiro, come closer...i have
an urgent request to make
of you.[BRK]

[POR01]
.....
......[BRK]

[POR22]
Please, go find my daughter
lemina.[BRK]

She's such an impulsive
girl.[BRK]

I know that she'd like
borgan, if she'd just get
to know him.[BRK]

[POR02]
But that floating dump
is a loser! I know it![BRK]

Just say 'no.'[BRK]

[POR22]
You don't understand. Borgan
has a heart of gold.[BRK]

He's just not very good
at relating to others.[BRK]

Please, just find lemina and
let her know i'll be fine.[BRK]

Once you find her, please
come back and let me know
she understands...[BRK]

I don't want to worry
about her...
[END]

=== e2 | 1be0a | 95 ===
[POR22]
Hiro! What are you doing
back here? You didn't find
my daughter, did you?![BRK]

Please! You must find lemina
and explain that i'll be
fine with borgan.[END]

=== e3 | 1bebe | ac ===
[POR22]
Hiro, i thought you were a
bright boy!?! What are you
doing back here?[BRK]

I need you to get my message
to lemina.[BRK]

Please find her and explain
that i'll be okay with
borgan.[END]

=== e4 | 1bf8a | 28e ===
[POR22]
Now that you've seen lemina
and the others, you know
they have the will to fight.[BRK]

They're never going to
surrender our world to
zophar.[BRK]

They believe in the power
of each other, and have the
will to overcome anything.[BRK]

You taught them that,
hiro.[BRK]

[POR01]
.....!?[BRK]

[POR22]
But if you forget to believe
in yourself, lucia truly
will be lost.[BRK]

And none of us wants to see
that...[BRK]

[POR01]
But...miria...i...
...i...[BRK]

[POR22]
Shhh! I'm still not sure
this is the right thing
to do, [BRK]

because i was told not to
tell anyone is this, [BRK]

but i think you're just
what this person needs
right now.[BRK]

Go to the roof.[BRK]

Someone is waiting there.[BRK]

Go! Quickly, now. See for
yourself...on the roof.
[END]

=== e5 | 1c230 | 90 ===

Hiro, why do you hesitate?
Are you afraid of who might
be waiting for you?[BRK]

Why have you suddenly turned
afraid? Go to the roof and 
find out![END]

=== e6 | 1c2d4 | 16d ===
[POR22]
Ghaleon...that name has been
stained in blood on this
place for centuries...[BRK]

Descendants of this city
lived in shame for years
because of his actions...[BRK]

But i always felt he must
have regretted his course
after it was too late.[BRK]

I sensed a very quiet
sadness in the things he
wrote before his death.[BRK]

To have all that power, and
yet...to be lonely beyond
words...
[END]

=== e7 | 1c454 | ef ===
[POR22]
So, i was right! Ghaleon has
come back to try to right
the wrongs he committed.[BRK]

Hiro, now your task carries
even greater weight. Ghaleon
is counting on you, too.[BRK]

With lemina at your side, I
pray you can save our world
from annihilation.[END]

=== e8 | 1c556 | 94 ===
[POR22]
In our world, the strongest
power is the power of belief
in the human spirit...[BRK]

You have proven that beyond
a shadow of a doubt.[BRK]

Well done, hiro![END]

[POR08]
It's strange...that sounds
like something i heard a
very long time ago...[END]

Long time no see, stranger![BRK]

Have you come to see lemina?
She's right over there.
[END]

You will reach lucia again,
but only if you resolve
never to accept defeat.[BRK]

Try hard, hiro. Love is
the only thing of true
worth in our world...[BRK]

I will never give up!![END]

=== ec | 1c7ac | 179 ===
[POR17]
Gwha ha ha ha! Ah, but i've
changed...really, i have![BRK]

And i have a very urgent
reason to be here.[BRK]

Perhaps you should catch up
on things with your mother,
dear girl.[BRK]

You may not be able to see
her for a while. She's going
on a...vacation, yes...[BRK]

It is such a pity when
people leave with issues
unresolved...[BRK]

[POR07]
What are you talking about,
borgan? You haven't changed
a bit!

[END]

=== ed | 1c93c | 287 ===

It's such a shame when
places of former glory fall
into neglect...[BRK]

happened to vane. The hand-
writing's on the walls..[BRK]

[POR07]
What? Vane is not destined
to disappear! I am working
to restore it![BRK]

[POR22]
Calm down, lemina. Listen to
what borgan has to say.[BRK]

You know, if you get past
the surface, he's very much
like you...[BRK]

[POR07]
Mother! How can you say such
a terrible thing?!! He's...
...he's......evil![BRK]

Why are you defending him?
He wants to kidnap you! Or
are you under his spell?[BRK]

Gha ha ha! I do not submit
my power for your approval,

I am absolute sovereign of
my destiny now. I will do
as i wish. Behold...

Poof! Mommy's gone! Gwa ha

Borgan! You oversized fecal
factory! What have you done
with my mother?!![BRK]

I demand that you return her
this minute![BRK]

[POR17]
Gwa ha ha ha! And i demand
that you think before you
speak, dear girl.[BRK]

Think of the power i hold.
I could crush you like a
twinkie.[BRK]

No, your mother will not be
coming back. She will rule
with me...in neo-vane![BRK]

And, oh...if you feel the
need to visit, please stop
by pentagulia...[BRK]

I have a summer cottage
there miria might enjoy.[BRK]

We'll be certain to roll out

With my magic power i'm not
qualified to be a bathroom
attendant...[BRK]

...let alone premier of the
magic guild of vane! Oh...[BRK]

What was i thinking?[BRK]

I can't even save the one
i love most! How can i hope

Oh, mother...i'm a failure!


[END]

The only real difference
between miria and i is in
magic power.[BRK]

But you ignorant fools have
lost all your magic power![BRK]

Do you know why you lost
your magic? Hmm?[BRK]

It was because lucia has
gained the power of althena
to fight zophar.[BRK]

All the world's power is at
her command.
[END]

daddy who's sweet on her.[END]
