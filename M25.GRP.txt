Ohhhh nooooo, look! It's

[POR09]
I sincerely hope you enjoyed
my little 'detour.'[BRK]

Face it! You simpletons are
no match for my superior
intellect.[BRK]

You can't escape the power
of the dragonship destiny![BRK]

Surrender now![BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro, he's right! We have
no chance of surviving a
blast from his ship![BRK]

What are we going to do?[BRK]

[POR08]
I cannot surrender. I must
accomplish my mission, so I
must fight.[BRK]

[POR05]
If luck goes our way, we
just might stand a chance.
I'm willing to try![BRK]

[POR10]
I knew that following you
guys was a mistake.[BRK]

But not fighting now would
be a bigger one.[BRK]

I'm in.[BRK]

[POR07]
This situation looks bad all
around, and i don't see how
i'll profit from fighting.[BRK]

Why don't we just surrender?[BRK]

[POR09]
Stop your little secret 
conference and surrender to
me immediately![BRK]

My given task is to execute
lucia before she destroys
us all.[BRK]

Know that i have the will
and the resources to carry
out that task...

[POR09]
What the hell?!!![END]

=== 3 | 4a28 | 88 ===
Ahhhh! The evil lucia
is raining fire down
upon us! Help![BRK]

[POR09]
You morons! There is no
danger! Althena will
protect us![BRK]

You can't be hurt![END]

I guess lord leo was
wrong.[BRK]

..........fancy that.[BRK]

[POR08]
This magic is strong...
could it be that......?[END]

=== 6 | 4b2a | 82 ===
[POR08]
It...it looked like...
.....ghaleon![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR08]
This doesn't make any sense.
Why would he go out of his
way to help us???[END]

=== 7 | 4bb0 | 53 ===
Lord leo has been badly
injured! Quick, we must
get him to safety![BRK]

Retreat at once![END]

=== 8 | 4c0c | d5 ===
[POR02]
Hrmph! What was that all
about?[BRK]

This whole trip just keeps
getting weirder and 
weirder...[BRK]

[POR05]
Agreed! I don't know what
the heck's goin' on anymore![BRK]

Anyway, it's bought us some
time. Let's take advantage
of it.[END]

[POR02]
Oh, my gosh...that was like
some endurance test gone
horribly wrong...[BRK]

I feel kinda...sick![BRK]

[POR07]
Ouugghh...i know what you
...mean...[BRK]

[POR05]
That has gotta be the
most bone-jarring detour
i've ever taken...[BRK]

Man, am i glad that's over!
Where the hell are we?[BRK]

[POR07]
I don't know, but i think
i'm gonna hurl again...[BRK]

[POR08]
Leo must have damaged the
magic arrow right before we
took off...[BRK]

[POR10]
But that means we could've
landed almost anywhere![BRK]

[POR07]
Doesn't anyone care that i'm
going to flood this place
with vomit any minute?[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

Is 'vomit' the same as the
liquid you deposited in the
magic arrow?[BRK]

Why do you do that? It has
a terrible stench and is
quite unattractive.[BRK]

Is it some kind of custom
from vane?[BRK]

[POR10]
Uh, lucia, we'll save that
lesson for later. [BRK]

Right now, we'd better find
a way out of here..........
..........wherever here is!

I sense an ancient magic in
this place...a seal, yes, a
magic seal...[BRK]

[POR07]
Really? I thought my magic
skills were excellent, but
i don't sense anything...[BRK]

[POR08]
This is a very old magic...
i doubt that humans could
detect it.[BRK]

Wait...i will try to remove
it...[END]

=== c | a022 | 111 ===
[POR07]
I...i...i've never heard the
magic you used uttered by
humans![BRK]

That sounded like magic that
only althena should know![BRK]

..............who are you??![BRK]

[POR08]
I have told you...my name
is lucia...i come from the
blue star.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Quickly...we must go while
the magic holds...[END]

[POR09]
Ah! Hiro! Fancy running into
you in a place like this![BRK]

You're looking mighty spry![BRK]

What brought you to this
dank old dungeon, anyway?[BRK]

And hey! What happened to
lucia?[BRK]

I thought you two would be
joined at the hip by now![BRK]

...she what? She went back
to the blue star? Why,
that's a travesty![BRK]

Let me help you in your   
quest to get back to her!
[0x5]Okay, if you want to.
Leo, that'd be so great![END]

=== e | a2e2 | c0 ===
[POR09]
Ha ha ha ha! Why would you
doubt my desire?[BRK]

Of course i'll help you
get back to lucia. You
two belong together.[BRK]

But you already know that.
I am in your service,
friend.[BRK]

Just lead the way...[END]

=== f | a3b2 | 83 ===
[POR09]
Don't mention it. This is
but a small down payment on
the debt of gratitude i owe.[BRK]

Now then, time's wasting...
let's get moving![END]

=== 10 | a454 | b8 ===
[POR02]
What the heck are you doing
looking that thing over 
again?[BRK]

You're not actually
considering riding it
again, are you?[BRK]

Sheesh! Thank god it's
broken! I just got over
the last ride...[END]

=== 11 | a51a | 79 ===
[POR07]
You know, if we could get
this thing working again,[BRK]

we could make a ton of
money! I'll have to remember
where it is...[END]

=== 12 | a5a2 | 66 ===
[POR02]
Hiro, remember when leo made
us wanna puke our guts out?[BRK]

I say we still owe him a
little payback...[END]

=== 13 | a616 | 50 ===
[POR09]
But i was under orders from
what i thought was althena![BRK]

You must understand!
