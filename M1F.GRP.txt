Well, well, now! This is
just what i like to see:
anxious customers![BRK]

Unfortunately, the carnival
is not quite set up yet, so
you'll have to come back.[BRK]

[POR02]
I knew it! I flew all the
way over here and the dumb
carnival isn't even open![END]

=== 1 | f5be | 99 ===
Well now, boys and girls,
come on in and see the best
carnival in the known world![BRK]

There's something for every-
one, so step right up and
see the sights![END]

=== 2 | f66a | d4 ===
When our world teetered on
the brink of destruction, I
thought the show was over.[BRK]

But now that the world has
been saved, i know that the
show must go on![BRK]

So come on in! Enjoy the
carnival and forget your
worries![END]

=== 3 | f752 | 74 ===
Oh, ms. Jean! Your song and
dance routine is a special
event, indeed.[BRK]

I'd love it if you'd perform
for us tonight.

[END]

=== 4 | f7de | 9f ===
Yippee! It's the carnival,
dagnabbit! The lights, the
smells, i just love it![BRK]

I've wanted to be a carnival
groupie since i was a boy,
and my dream's come true![END]

=== 5 | f88a | 2c ===
[POR08]
What are...carnival...
......groupies? 

[END]

=== 6 | f8d2 | 72 ===
There's no place in the
world i'd rather be than
the carnival![BRK]

I've always been entranced
by the lights and music.[END]

=== 7 | f958 | 94 ===
You know, kiddies, my
favorite thing is watching
the magic arrow fly.[BRK]

When people get off that
thing, by crackee, they
spew geysers![BRK]

It's hilarious![END]

=== 8 | fa04 | 95 ===
What? You say my grand-
daughter's looking for me?[BRK]

Why in tarnation would she
be looking for me?[BRK]

She knows i'm following the
carnival now. Crazy kid![END]

=== 9 | faa8 | c4 ===
Oh, i remember now. I went
and got that crazy kid from
her parents in larpa.[BRK]

Promised to show her the
sights of the carnival.[BRK]

I musta forgot all about
her once i got here. I
wonder where she went?[END]

=== a | fb80 | 94 ===
Have you seen my grampa?
He took me to this place,
then disappeared.[BRK]

I'm scared. Mommy and daddy
are back home, and i don't
know how to get there...[END]

=== b | fc22 | c7 ===
You...you have special
clothes. Are you a member
of the carnival?[BRK]

[POR08]
Carnival...?[BRK]

[POR00]
Do you do tricks or some
fun thing? [BRK]

Maybe you can make my grampa
appear...i'm scared that he
won't come back...

[END]

=== c | fd00 | 3b ===
Where is my grampa? I can't
find my way home without
him...[END]

=== d | fd52 | 76 ===
Mommy and daddy said grampa
would watch me at the 
carnival.[BRK]

Now grampa has gone away,
and i don't know where he
is...[END]

=== e | fddc | 115 ===
Grampa will get in trouble
if my mommy and daddy find
out about this.[BRK]

Daddy will be real mad. The
last time grampa took me,
he left me at the store.[BRK]

I think he's getting too old
to go places by himself.[BRK]

Say, lady, you look like a
magic performer. Can you
make grampa come back?[END]

=== f | ff08 | 7a ===
Grampa, if you don't start
remembering better,[BRK]

mommy and daddy are going
to put you away in a home.[BRK]

I heard them say that.[END]

=== 10 | ff96 | f2 ===
Step right up, one and
all! Examine the mystery
and beauty of fire.[BRK]

You're looking at the
world's best human flame-
thrower![BRK]

Watch in amazement as I
spew streams of flame high
into the air.[BRK]

[POR02]
So he spits fire. Big deal.
I can do that, too...[END]

=== 11 | 10092 | 70 ===
Wow, that looks like some
kind of natural ability you
have there...[BRK]

Wanna join the carnival?[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, no...thanks.[END]

=== 12 | 1011a | cc ===
Step right up...step close
as you dare and witness the
human flamethrower![BRK]

A freak of nature that can
spew flame high into the
air! Watch and see![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

And, uh, kids...don't try
this at home...ok?

[END]

=== 13 | 101fa | ad ===
I heard from jean that you
are a real red dragon![BRK]

Will you show me the way
you spout flame? Please?[BRK]

[POR02]
Sorry, i'm an adult now. To
show off just for you would
be childish...[END]

=== 14 | 102b0 | 4c ===
Ohh, that's so depressing.
I was so looking forward
to seeing you spew fire![END]

=== 15 | 10314 | 95 ===
Look, one and all, upon the
face of an oddity! A human
flamethrower![BRK]

Please, turn away if you
have a weak stomach. He will
spew flame from his mouth![END]

=== 16 | 103bc | 7a ===
Hey there, kids! Want one
of my colorful balloons?[BRK]

I just made a new batch!
The gas inside them can
lift you into the sky![END]

=== 17 | 1044c | 106 ===
[POR02]
Hiro! Hiro! Please? Can we
get some balloons? I want
to fly with one![BRK]

[POR05]
What are you talking about,
ruby? You always fly![BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, you are the biggest
drag on my enthusiasm![BRK]

Every adventure party has a
pooper. That's why we
invited you...[BRK]

...party pooper!
[END]

=== 18 | 1056a | 64 ===
Say, how 'bout a nice new
balloon to brighten your day
and lift your spirits?[BRK]

Just made a new batch![END]

=== 19 | 105de | d2 ===
Say, why don't you buy some
of my colorful balloons?[BRK]

If you buy a whole lot,
they'll lift you into the
sky![BRK]

[POR02]
I'm not some stupid kid you
can sucker in with that
tired sales pitch![BRK]

...but i will take just one.[END]

=== 1a | 106c4 | 51 ===
Enjoy our carnival, see the
sights, and don't forget to
visit the hall of chance![END]

=== 1b | 1072e | 1e7 ===
[POR05]
This is some sort of
gamblin' joint? Whoo-hoo!
I'll get my dice![BRK]

[POR07]
Ronfar? Where is your head?
We don't have time to spend
gambling![BRK]

[POR05]
Speaking of party poopers,
i'd say that little missy
money-pants is it![BRK]

Besides, i can double my
money in no time flat![BRK]

[POR07]
Double...did you say double
your money?[BRK]

Well, maybe we do have just
a little time to hang around
here...[BRK]

...as long as you double my
money, too.[BRK]

[POR02]
Look at that, hiro. Ronfar's
got lemina hooked now! How
completely pathetic![END]

=== 1c | 1092c | 4d ===
Come on in, see the lights,
place a bet, take a chance!
It's all in good fun![END]

=== 1d | 10988 | 4d ===
Come one, come all! There's
always a new game starting
in the hall of chance![END]

=== 1e | 109e2 | 11b ===
[POR05]
My dice are red-hot! I've
gotta take another crack
at the games in there![BRK]

I can double my money in
just a few minutes![BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, i think you're using
a lifetime's worth of luck
tonight. [BRK]

You'd better quit while
you're ahead...[BRK]

[POR05]
You really know how to drag
a guy down, don't ya?[END]

=== 1f | 10b0c | 38 ===
Don't bother me now. I have
to concentrate on this song.[END]

=== 20 | 10b54 | 62 ===
If you make me mess up this
song, my daughter is going
to be mad.[BRK]

So just don't talk to me,
okay?

This song brings back the
sweetest of memories...[BRK]

That was the song my wife
used to love...[BRK]

I sang it to her when I
proposed marriage...[END]

=== 27 | 10ece | 8a ===
I was such a shy boy, not
really sure of what i was
doing...[BRK]

But i was headed off to
war, and i knew that i had
to ask her before i left.
[END]

=== 28 | 10f6c | e2 ===
After my wife died, i used
this song to keep her alive
in my heart.[BRK]

She was my one and only
love. Her passing was a
great loss to me...[BRK]

But i don't cry anymore,
because we are still as one,[BRK]

joined in a love that is
eternal...

One day, i hope you find
someone to love as deeply

Hey jean! Long time, no
see, girl![BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah, long time no see!
Say, what happened to you?
What's with the outfit?[BRK]

[POR00]
Well, i changed my clothes
for the carnival. I wasn't
getting much dancing work.[BRK]

But as a bunnygirl, i'm
really in demand![BRK]

[POR10]
Isn't that kind of demeaning
to women?[BRK]

[POR00]
Uh...well...




[END]

=== 2b | 111fc | 7e ===
I heard from giban you
won't dance at the carnival
this year, jean[BRK]

i'm kinda disappointed. I
wanted to see you dance
again....[END]

=== 2c | 11296 | 98 ===
Jean! Speaking of changes,
what happened to you? This
is definitely a new look![BRK]

[POR10]
I'm helping out a friend by
using my knowledge of blue
dragon karate.[END]

=== 2d | 1134e | b2 ===
Girls have come from all
across the land to dance at
the carnival this year.[BRK]

I'm sure that none of them
hold a candle to you, jean.[BRK]

You've got to come back next
year and dance...[END]

=== 2e | 11418 | 8b ===
Jean's dancing is good, but
don't you think she'd look
sexier in this bunny outfit?[BRK]

I certainly think she would.
I know the guys'll dig it![END]

=== 2f | 114b6 | a2 ===
Jean's dancing is the best
in the land.[BRK]

After she came back, the
carnival business went
through the roof![BRK]

People came from as far
away as dalton to see her
dance![END]

=== 30 | 1156c | 83 ===
Oh, jean! I wish i could
dance half as well as you![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't be so hard on
yourself! Enjoy what you do
and it'll show in your work![END]

=== 31 | 11602 | 7b ===
Hey...that looks like a
mighty rare flying cat![BRK]

Say, why don't you let me
put it in our freak gallery?
It'll make you rich![END]

=== 32 | 1168a | 86 ===
[POR07]
Stop that silly talk this
instant! That's so inhumane
even i wouldn't do it![BRK]

[POR02]
Says who? This girl is
talking about serious money![END]

=== 33 | 11728 | b6 ===
I'm telling you, a few short
months with your cat in the
sideshow,[BRK]

...and we can all retire![BRK]

[POR02]
I don't want to hear you
suggest that again![BRK]

I am not just some dumb
animal, you know![END]

=== 34 | 117ee | d5 ===
I heard a rumor that this
cat is really the actual
red dragon![BRK]

If that's true, one week
in the sideshow and we'd
all be able to retire![BRK]

[POR02]
No, no, no! I will not let
you put me on display like,
like some...animal![END]

=== 35 | 118d0 | 98 ===
[POR07]
But ruby, you are an animal
...in a weird sort of way...[BRK]

Why not turn that gift into
hard cash for all of us?[BRK]

You know, a gift that keeps
on giving!

Jean? Jean?!! Where are you

I'll never forgive you for
this! Booo hoooo hoooo![BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sorry you missed my

I have things to do, but

A girl could get hurt if

...jean!?[BRK]

What's the matter, jean?[BRK]

[POR10]
Listen, giban, i don't have 
time to tell you everything
that's going on right now.[BRK]

In short, althena's cult has
blocked the passage to get 
to western nota and beyond.[BRK]

Giban, i want you to use the
magic arrow to fly us to
west nota.[BRK]

[POR00]
...you can't be serious!?[BRK]

The magic arrow has not
been fully tested at that
distance![BRK]

[POR09]
Who's in charge of this
drunken revelry?! Come
forth![BRK]

I am leo, white knight of
althena's guard. Again,
who is in charge?![BRK]

[POR00]
Oh dear...they've found
you...[BRK]

Don't worry, jean, i'll take
care of this...[END]

=== 47 | 13786 | 174 ===
[POR09]
You there! I am looking for
a woman that may have passed
through this carnival.[BRK]

She's dressed in an unusual
red cloth. Have you seen 
her?[BRK]

[POR00]
...as you can see, sir, 
we've been here for some
time,[BRK]

but no one that fits your
description passed through
here...[BRK]

[POR09]
I trust that you are telling
the truth...[BRK]

But i warn you. It is not
wise to betray my trust!
Remember that![END]

All right, men, search the
area! Leave no stone
unturned!

=== 49 | 13948 | 26b ===
[POR10]
...thank you, giban. Leo 
is relentless. He wants
lucia here...[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, you don't have to
thank me.[BRK]

I would hide anybody that
althena's guard is 
searching for.[BRK]

I've seen them punish too 
many innocent people. They
have no honor.[BRK]

You know, lucia is too easy
to spot in that clothing...[BRK]

Jean, why don't you take 
her to the costume tent and
get her some new clothes?[BRK]

[POR08]
New clothes!? But i've
never worn any other![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't worry, lucia, i'll help
you find your style...[BRK]

[POR07]
I'll help you too! I love
doing makeovers![BRK]

[POR02]
Don't leave me out! I wanna
help, too![BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, you know where the
costumes are. Help yourself.
[END]

=== 4a | 13bca | 7b ===
[POR00]
I'll let you use the magic
arrow once lucia is finished
changing.[BRK]

For now, you'd better stay
close. It's safer that way.[END]

=== 4b | 13c5c | fc ===
[POR00]
...whoa! Those clothes
really do you justice,
lucia.[BRK]

I've finished preparing
the magic arrow, but you
must ask the old man first.[BRK]

[POR10]
I appreciate your kindness,
giban. You are truly a good
friend.[BRK]

[POR00]
I am the one that should
be thanking you, jean.

Good! If you're not in a

[POR10]
I have to. My friends need

You have always placed

I'll be back before you even

missing me![END]

Look! There's a tear in

I just must...blend in

The type of clothing does
not matter...[BRK]

[POR10]
Come on, lucia! Of course it
matters. You have to make
a statement with your dress![BRK]

You should choose the most

peep show![BRK]

Lucia, you can't let guys

Oh, uh...no! No! Everything

Jean, i haven't seen you

What? You want to fly to
west nota using the magic
arrow?[BRK]

It's fine with me, but you
need to ask giban first.[END]

=== 60 | 1499e | ac ===
Giban said you can use the
arrow...[BRK]

Give me a few minutes to get
everything all set up...[BRK]

Don't worry, you're in good
hands, now. I'll make sure
the arrow gets you to nota.[END]

=== 61 | 14a5e | ce ===
The arrow is all finished.[BRK]

Just wait a second while I
make one final adjustment to
the destinationometer...[BRK]

The darned thing's so
touchy...[BRK]

If that thing goes out of
whack, no tellin' where
you'll end up...[END]

I'm afraid your itinerary
has changed...[BRK]

Ha ha ha ha ha![END]

Well, don't blame me! Leo's

change of flight plans!

[END]

=== 68 | 14d58 | 95 ===
I think i can build a better
arrow. I just need someone
to test it out...[BRK]

I'm sorry, but after the

ready to volunteer...[END]

I'm working hard to finish
the new magic arrow so you

to try it out.[END]

you check my store first,
okay?[END]

I have to beat 'em back with

What are you talking about,
ronfar? Usually the women
are running away from you.[END]

=== 73 | 1534c | 88 ===
Oh, i just don't know
what to do![BRK]

I guess i need to hire some
bodyguards to keep my fans
away from me.[BRK]

Being a celebrity sure does
suck![END]

[POR05]
Amen, brother![END]

I really need to get a

take care of this for me.
[END]

I give and i give and it's

Just go! It'll never be good
enough for you anyway...
leave me...[END]

Hiro, you're not seriously

I have taught all the great

My latest protege is jean.[BRK]

This is terrible! My star

guard![END]

Don't forget to practice
your dancing every day,
jean.[BRK]

If you miss just one
practice, your skills will
start to fade.[BRK]

I know, practice makes 
perfect, blah, blah, blah...

Oh!? You guys...
what's...what's happened
to jean?[END]

=== 7d | 15846 | cd ===
Love the new outfit, jean!
I think it really makes
you look hot![BRK]

Maybe when you come back,
you can teach me karate.[BRK]

Then i can be a karate and
dance expert, and i can 
raise my rates. [BRK]

[POR10]
Uh, yeah...right.[END]

=== 7e | 1592a | 4d ===
Since jean has become 
famous, my dancing school
has become full of students.[END]

=== 7f | 1598a | 98 ===
After one lesson of karate
with jean, i stopped taking
lessons from her.[BRK]

I got tired of her kicking
the snot out of me. I think
i'll stick to dancing...[END]

=== 80 | 15a36 | 89 ===
Jean!? Are you going back
on the road with your 
friends?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah, it's time that we
finally bring an end to
this chapter of hiro's life.[END]

=== 81 | 15ad2 | 9c ===
I'm the best dancer in this
whole place. I've never met
my equal.[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sure you've worked hard
to become so. Have you seen
me dance?[BRK]

...just wondering...
[END]

=== 82 | 15b86 | a2 ===
I just won the world
dancing competition...[BRK]

Some of the people say I
only won because jean wasn't
able to attend...[BRK]

[POR10]
Enjoy the victory. You
earned it, i'm sure.[END]

=== 83 | 15c3c | 54 ===
Lord leo certainly seemed
to be agitated![BRK]

What's the big deal? It's
just one girl...[END]

=== 84 | 15ca8 | ac ===
I've heard that you won't
be coming back for a
while...[BRK]

That's too bad. I guess
everyone will have to enjoy
my dancing.[BRK]

[POR10]
Just keep them entertained
until i get back!




[END]

Jean, you seem to be
totally, like, happy.[BRK]

Did you get some?[BRK]

You know, just between
you and me...

[END]

=== 86 | 15dea | a3 ===
Jean, what's this new
outfit?[BRK]

Does this mean that you're
going to give up dancing
for good?[BRK]

[POR10]
No, no. I'm only doing this
temporarily. I'll be back
to dance soon.[END]

=== 87 | 15eac | 41 ===
I just can't find my way. I
don't know what life has to
offer me.[END]

I've been dancing my legs
off and all i keep hearing
is how great jean is.[BRK]

Don't walk away from me,
jean! We have a score to
settle.
[END]

Jeeeaaannn...
have you finally returned
to dance?[BRK]

It's about time we see who
the best dancer is in this
carnival.[BRK]

[POR10]
No! I'm just getting ready 
to leave again. I'll see you
later![END]

=== 8a | 1607c | 1f1 ===
[POR10]
You came back, just like
you promised![BRK]

[POR02]
Jean, i always thought
you looked best dressed
as a dancer.[BRK]

[POR10]
Thanks, ruby. I like being
a dancer. Say, where's
lucia?[BRK]

After all, i did promise her
that i would do a dance for
her once we defeated zophar.[BRK]

What's wrong with hiro? His
eyes seem so...distant, so
...lost...[BRK]

What!? Lucia went back to
the blue star without hiro?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Hiro, are you sure you want
to go to the blue star?[BRK]

Well, you know you can
always count on me! Do
you want my help?[END]

=== 8b | 16270 | 34 ===
[0x5]No, i'll do it myself.
Yes, jean, i need your help.[END]

=== 8c | 162b4 | ae ===
[POR10]
Okay, if that's how you
feel, hiro. But i'm ready
to help any time![BRK]

After all, you helped me
defeat lunn and put an end
to the blue dragon cult.[BRK]

Come on, let me help you.
[END]

=== 8d | 16378 | 7f ===
[POR10]
All right!! This is going to
be just like old times.[BRK]

Excuse me while i go put
on something a little
bit more appropriate...
[END]

=== 8e | 1640a | a1 ===
[POR10]
Guess i shouldn't have said
i'd never use karate again,
eh?[BRK]

But this is kind of a
special case.[BRK]

We've got to find a way for
you to get back to the blue
star!
[END]

=== 8f | 164c6 | 95 ===
[POR10]
Hiro, stop your complaining!
I already told you i'm
willing to help![BRK]

Are you just going to sit

Do you want my help or

Ahh! Hey, there's jean!
Say, jean, have you come
back to join the carnival?[BRK]

[POR10]
No, no. I just stopped by
for a visit. I still have
other things to do.[BRK]

[POR00]
Shucks, that sucks. We want
you to come back and dance
with us![END]

=== 93 | 171ce | 2f ===
I wish you didn't have to
leave us again, jean.[END]

=== 94 | 17210 | 6e ===
I saw you guys fly in the
magic arrow! It was sooo
cool![BRK]

...but weren't you afraid?
It was so high in the air![END]

=== 95 | 1728c | 2d ===
[POR10]
Me? Afraid? Naaah. It was a
piece of cake![END]

=== 96 | 172d0 | b8 ===
Wow jean, that karate suit
really makes you look
dangerous.[BRK]

Do you think you can teach
me blue dragon karate some-
day?[BRK]

[POR10]
Sure. I'd be happy to teach
you the way of the blue
dragon...[END]

=== 97 | 173b4 | b5 ===
It's sooo cool that jean
has come back![BRK]

She teaches me karate every
day after she finishes her
dance.[BRK]

Pretty soon, i'll be big and
strong enough to protect
everyone in the carnival![END]

=== 98 | 1747c | 6b ===
I'll keep practicing the
things you taught me, jean![BRK]

[POR10]
Keep it up. You're going to
be very strong someday![END]

=== 99 | 174fa | 5e ===
Don't bother me! I'm
practicing my new dance![BRK]

Even jean will not be
able to best me this time![END]

=== 9a | 1756c | 93 ===
J-jean! You came to the
carnival! Are you still
keeping up on your dance?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes. I have a new step that
i'll show you when i rejoin
the carnival.
[END]

=== 9b | 17612 | a0 ===
I watched as you guys got
to ride the magic arrow.[BRK]

It seemed to go so high!
I was afraid you might not
survive.[BRK]

Especially since lord leo
changed it all around![END]

=== 9c | 176ce | 8f ===
Jean?! What are you doing
in a karate suit?[BRK]

Have you...given up
dancing?[BRK]

[POR10]
No, i just have to help
a friend...i'll be back here
in no time...
[END]

=== 9d | 1777c | 8d ===
Honestly, jean, i've never
seen you in better shape.[BRK]

[POR10]
I've been practicing my
karate and doing something
new called 'aerobics.'

I really miss having the
competition between me and
jean...[END]

I'm glad jean's back now,
but i also worry that she's
become a better dancer.[BRK]

Oh no! What will happen to
me if she has improved her
dance skills?!![BRK]

I'll be dead meat! No one
will want to see me dance![END]

her love for me because she
is so shy.[END]

Ah, my sweet moncherie.
You have come back to your
one true love.[BRK]

I have waited for you to

fire, but we weren't even
friends, remember?

My sweet jean, come into my

Love we once knew? I think
you're thinking about that
doll in your closet...[BRK]

We were never in love.[END]

Jean, jean, jean! Do not
tear my beating heart from

Come back to me now...all

serious psychiatric help...[END]

Enter my willing embrace and

Has jean gone away to hide
from my affection?[BRK]

Tell me where she is, so

Giban, i want you to use the

I am leo, white knight of

I would hide anybody that
althena's guard is 
searching for.[BRK]

I've seen them punish too 
many innocent people. They
have no honor...[BRK]

You know, lucia is too easy
to spot in that clothing...[BRK]

Jean, why don't you take 
her to the costume tent and
get her some new clothes?[BRK]

New clothes!? But i've
never worn any other![BRK]

Don't worry, lucia, i'll
help you find your style...[BRK]

Love the new outfit, jean!
I think it really makes
you look hot![BRK]

Maybe when you come back,
you can teach me karate.[BRK]

Then i can be a karate and
dance expert, and i can 
raise my rates. [BRK]

[POR10]
Uh, yeah...right.[END]

=== 13d | 1fd10 | 4d ===
Since jean has become 
famous, my dancing school
has become full of students.[END]

=== 13e | 1fd70 | 98 ===
After one lesson of karate
with jean, i stopped taking
lessons from her.[BRK]

I got tired of her kicking
the snot out of me. I think
i'll stick to dancing...[END]

=== 13f | 1fe1c | 89 ===
Jean!? Are you going back
on the road with your 
friends?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah. It's time that we
finally bring an end to
this chapter of hiro's life.[END]

=== 140 | 1feb8 | 9c ===
I'm the best dancer in this
whole place. I've never met
my equal.[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sure you've worked hard
to become so. Have you seen
me dance?[BRK]

...just wondering...
[END]

=== 141 | 1ff6c | a2 ===
I just won the world
dancing competition...[BRK]

Some of the people say I
only won because jean wasn't
able to attend...[BRK]

[POR10]
Enjoy the victory. You
earned it, i'm sure.[END]

=== 142 | 20022 | 54 ===
Lord leo certainly seemed
to be agitated![BRK]

What's the big deal? It's
just one girl...[END]

=== 143 | 2008e | ac ===
I've heard that you won't be
coming back for a while...[BRK]

That's too bad. I guess 
everyone will have to enjoy
my dancing.[BRK]

[POR10]
Just keep them entertained
until i get back!



[END]

=== 144 | 20152 | 63 ===
Jean, you seem to be
totally, like, happy.[BRK]

Did you get some?[BRK]

You know, just between you
and me...

[END]

=== 145 | 201d0 | a3 ===
Jean, what's this new
outfit?[BRK]

Does this mean that you're
going to give up dancing
for good?[BRK]

[POR10]
No, no. I'm only doing this
temporarily. I'll be back
to dance soon.[END]

=== 146 | 20292 | 41 ===
I just can't find my way. I
don't know what life has to
offer me.[END]

=== 147 | 202fe | 85 ===
I've been dancing my legs
off and all i hear is how
great jean is...[BRK]

Don't walk away from me,
jean! We have a score to
settle.






[END]

=== 148 | 20396 | b4 ===
Jeeeaaannn...
have you finally returned
to dance?[BRK]

It's about time we see who
the best dancer is in this
carnival.[BRK]

[POR10]
No! I'm just getting ready 
to leave again. I'll see you
later![END]

=== 149 | 20462 | 1f1 ===
[POR10]
You came back, just like
you promised![BRK]

[POR02]
Jean, i always thought
you looked best dressed
as a dancer.[BRK]

[POR10]
Thanks, ruby. I like being
a dancer. Say, where's
lucia?[BRK]

After all, i did promise her
that i would do a dance for
her once we defeated zophar.[BRK]

What's wrong with hiro? His
eyes seem so...distant, so
...lost...[BRK]

What!? Lucia went back to
the blue star without hiro?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Hiro, are you sure you want
to go to the blue star?[BRK]

Well, you know you can
always count on me! Do
you want my help?[END]

=== 14a | 20656 | 34 ===
[0x5]No, i'll do it myself.
Yes, jean, i need your help.[END]

=== 14b | 2069a | ae ===
[POR10]
Okay, if that's how you
feel, hiro. But i'm ready
to help any time![BRK]

After all, you helped me
defeat lunn and put an end
to the blue dragon cult.[BRK]

Come on, let me help you.
[END]

=== 14c | 2075e | 7f ===
[POR10]
All right!! This is going to
be just like old times.[BRK]

Excuse me while i go put
on something a little
bit more appropriate...
[END]

=== 14d | 207f0 | a1 ===
[POR10]
Guess i shouldn't have said
i'd never use karate again,
eh?[BRK]

But this is kind of a
special case.[BRK]

We've got to find a way for
you to get back to the blue
star!
[END]

=== 14e | 208ac | 95 ===
[POR10]
Hiro, stop your complaining!
I already told you i'm
willing to help![BRK]

Are you just going to sit 
there and act stupid? [BRK]

Do you want my help or
not?[END]
