Well, well, now! This is
just what I like to see:
anxious customers![BRK]

Unfortunately, the carnival
is not quite set up yet, so
you'll have to come back.[BRK]

[POR02]
I knew it! I flew all the
way over here and the dumb
carnival isn't even open![END]

=== 1 | f5be | 99 ===
Well now, boys and girls,
come on in and see the best
carnival in the known world![BRK]

There's something for every-
one, so step right up and
see the sights![END]

=== 2 | f66a | d4 ===
When our world teetered on
the brink of destruction, I
thought the show was over.[BRK]

But now that the world has
been saved, I know that the
show must go on![BRK]

So come on in! Enjoy the
carnival and forget your
worries![END]

=== 3 | f752 | 74 ===
Oh, Ms. Jean! Your song and
dance routine is a special
event, indeed.[BRK]

I'd love it if you'd perform
for us tonight.[END]

=== 4 | f7de | 9f ===
Yippee! It's the carnival,
dagnabbit! The lights, the
smells, I just love it![BRK]

I've wanted to be a carnival
groupie since I was a boy,
and my dream's come true![END]

=== 5 | f88a | 2c ===
[POR08]
What are...carnival...
......groupies? [END]

=== 6 | f8d2 | 72 ===
There's no place in the
world I'd rather be than
the carnival![BRK]

I've always been entranced
by the lights and music.[END]

=== 7 | f958 | 94 ===
You know, kiddies, my
favorite thing is watching
the Magic Arrow fly.[BRK]

When people get off that
thing, by crackee, they
spew geysers![BRK]

It's hilarious![END]

=== 8 | fa04 | 95 ===
What? You say my grand-
daughter's looking for me?[BRK]

Why in tarnation would she
be looking for me?[BRK]

She knows I'm following the
carnival now. Crazy kid![END]

=== 9 | faa8 | c4 ===
Oh, I remember now. I went
and got that crazy kid from
her parents in Larpa.[BRK]

Promised to show her the
sights of the carnival.[BRK]

I musta forgot all about
her once I got here. I
wonder where she went?[END]

=== a | fb80 | 94 ===
Have you seen my grampa?
He took me to this place,
then disappeared.[BRK]

I'm scared. Mommy and Daddy
are back home, and I don't
know how to get there...[END]

=== b | fc22 | c7 ===
You...You have special
clothes. Are you a member
of the carnival?[BRK]

[POR08]
Carnival...?[BRK]

[POR00]
Do you do tricks or some
fun thing? [BRK]

Maybe you can make my grampa
appear...I'm scared that he
won't come back...[END]

=== c | fd00 | 3b ===
Where is my grampa? I can't
find my way home without
him...[END]

=== d | fd52 | 76 ===
Mommy and Daddy said Grampa
would watch me at the 
carnival.[BRK]

Now Grampa has gone away,
and I don't know where he
is...[END]

=== e | fddc | 115 ===
Grampa will get in trouble
if my mommy and daddy find
out about this.[BRK]

Daddy will be real mad. The
last time Grampa took me,
he left me at the store.[BRK]

I think he's getting too old
to go places by himself.[BRK]

Say, lady, you look like a
magic performer. Can you
make Grampa come back?[END]

=== f | ff08 | 7a ===
Grampa, if you don't start
remembering better,[BRK]

Mommy and Daddy are going
to put you away in a home.[BRK]

I heard them say that.[END]

=== 10 | ff96 | f2 ===
Step right up, one and
all! Examine the mystery
and beauty of fire.[BRK]

You're looking at the
world's best human flame-
thrower![BRK]

Watch in amazement as I
spew streams of flame high
into the air.[BRK]

[POR02]
So he spits fire. Big deal.
I can do that, too...[END]

=== 11 | 10092 | 70 ===
Wow, that looks like some
kind of natural ability you
have there...[BRK]

Wanna join the carnival?[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, no...thanks.[END]

=== 12 | 1011a | cc ===
Step right up...Step close
as you dare and witness the
human flamethrower![BRK]

A freak of nature that can
spew flame high into the
air! Watch and see![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

And, uh, kids...don't try
this at home...OK?[END]

=== 13 | 101fa | ad ===
I heard from Jean that you
are a real Red Dragon![BRK]

Will you show me the way
you spout flame? Please?[BRK]

[POR02]
Sorry, I'm an adult now. To
show off just for you would
be childish...[END]

=== 14 | 102b0 | 4c ===
Ohh, that's so depressing.
I was so looking forward
to seeing you spew fire![END]

=== 15 | 10314 | 95 ===
Look, one and all, upon the
face of an oddity! A human
flamethrower![BRK]

Please, turn away if you
have a weak stomach. He will
spew flame from his mouth![END]

=== 16 | 103bc | 7a ===
Hey there, kids! Want one
of my colorful balloons?[BRK]

I just made a new batch!
The gas inside them can
lift you into the sky![END]

=== 17 | 1044c | 106 ===
[POR02]
Hiro! Hiro! Please? Can we
get some balloons? I want
to fly with one![BRK]

[POR05]
What are you talking about,
Ruby? You always fly![BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, you are the biggest
drag on my enthusiasm![BRK]

Every adventure party has a
pooper. That's why we
invited you...[BRK]

...Party pooper![END]

=== 18 | 1056a | 64 ===
Say, how 'bout a nice new
balloon to brighten your day
and lift your spirits?[BRK]

Just made a new batch![END]

=== 19 | 105de | d2 ===
Say, why don't you buy some
of my colorful balloons?[BRK]

If you buy a whole lot,
they'll lift you into the
sky![BRK]

[POR02]
I'm not some stupid kid you
can sucker in with that
tired sales pitch![BRK]

...But I will take just one.[END]

=== 1a | 106c4 | 51 ===
Enjoy our carnival, see the
sights, and don't forget to
visit the Hall of Chance![END]

=== 1b | 1072e | 1e7 ===
[POR05]
This is some sort of
gamblin' joint? Whoo-hoo!
I'll get my dice![BRK]

[POR07]
Ronfar? Where is your head?
We don't have time to spend
gambling![BRK]

[POR05]
Speaking of party poopers,
I'd say that little missy
money-pants is it![BRK]

Besides, I can double my
money in no time flat![BRK]

[POR07]
Double...Did you say double
your money?[BRK]

Well, maybe we do have just
a little time to hang around
here...[BRK]

...as long as you double my
money, too.[BRK]

[POR02]
Look at that, Hiro. Ronfar's
got Lemina hooked now! How
completely pathetic![END]

=== 1c | 1092c | 4d ===
Come on in, see the lights,
place a bet, take a chance!
It's all in good fun![END]

=== 1d | 10988 | 4d ===
Come one, come all! There's
always a new game starting
in the Hall of Chance![END]

=== 1e | 109e2 | 11b ===
[POR05]
My dice are red-hot! I've
gotta take another crack
at the games in there![BRK]

I can double my money in
just a few minutes![BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, I think you're using
a lifetime's worth of luck
tonight. [BRK]

You'd better quit while
you're ahead...[BRK]

[POR05]
You really know how to drag
a guy down, don't ya?[END]

=== 1f | 10b0c | 38 ===
Don't bother me now. I have
to concentrate on this song.[END]

=== 20 | 10b54 | 62 ===
If you make me mess up this
song, my daughter is going
to be mad.[BRK]

So just don't talk to me,
okay?[END]

=== 21 | 10bca | 84 ===
[0xDB]La la la la la...[BRK]

[0xDB]When I was alone as one,
my eyes were as blind,
I know[0xDB].[BRK]

[0xDB]Sky, brilliant with blue
elegance[0xDB], I couldn't behold.[END]

=== 22 | 10c5c | 30 ===
When I was alone as one...[BRK]

[POR08]
La la la la la....[END]

=== 23 | 10ca4 | 70 ===
[0xDB]When I was alone as one,
my heart was as ice,[0xDB]
I know[0xDB].[BRK]

[0xDB]Wind whispering sweet
melodies, I could not
behold.[0xDB].[END]

=== 24 | 10d28 | 9a ===
[0xDB]Laa, la la[0xDB] la...[BRK]

[0xDB]Sight to my eyes, and
warmth to my heart[0xDB][BRK]

[0xDB]La la la la la laaaa...[BRK]

[POR02]
Hey, Hiro! Isn't this the
song Lucia really liked?[BRK]

[POR01]

[0xDB]Our love eternal shall
be...destiny[0xDB][BRK]

[0xDB]Laaa, la la la la lala...[END]

=== 26 | 10e2e | 88 ===
This song brings back the
sweetest of memories...[BRK]

That was the song my wife
used to love...[BRK]

I sang it to her when I
proposed marriage...[END]

=== 27 | 10ece | 8a ===
I was such a shy boy, not
really sure of what I was
doing...[BRK]

But I was headed off to
war, and I knew that I had
to ask her before I left.[END]

=== 28 | 10f6c | e2 ===
After my wife died, I used
this song to keep her alive
in my heart.[BRK]

She was my one and only
love. Her passing was a
great loss to me...[BRK]

But I don't cry anymore,
because we are still as one,[BRK]

joined in a love that is
eternal...[END]

=== 29 | 11066 | 3f ===
One day, I hope you find
someone to love as deeply
as I have...[END]

=== 2a | 110b8 | 12d ===
Hey Jean! Long time, no
see, girl![BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah, long time no see!
Say, what happened to you?
What's with the outfit?[BRK]

[POR00]
Well, I changed my clothes
for the carnival. I wasn't
getting much dancing work.[BRK]

But as a bunnygirl, I'm
really in demand![BRK]

[POR10]
Isn't that kind of demeaning
to women?[BRK]

[POR00]
Uh...well...[END]

=== 2b | 111fc | 7e ===
I heard from Giban you
won't dance at the carnival
this year, Jean[BRK]

I'm kinda disappointed. I
wanted to see you dance
again....[END]

=== 2c | 11296 | 98 ===
Jean! Speaking of changes,
what happened to you? This
is definitely a new look![BRK]

[POR10]
I'm helping out a friend by
using my knowledge of Blue
Dragon Karate.[END]

=== 2d | 1134e | b2 ===
Girls have come from all
across the land to dance at
the carnival this year.[BRK]

I'm sure that none of them
hold a candle to you, Jean.[BRK]

You've got to come back next
year and dance...[END]

=== 2e | 11418 | 8b ===
Jean's dancing is good, but
don't you think she'd look
sexier in this bunny outfit?[BRK]

I certainly think she would.
I know the guys'll dig it![END]

=== 2f | 114b6 | a2 ===
Jean's dancing is the best
in the land.[BRK]

After she came back, the
carnival business went
through the roof![BRK]

People came from as far
away as Dalton to see her
dance![END]

=== 30 | 1156c | 83 ===
Oh, Jean! I wish I could
dance half as well as you![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't be so hard on
yourself! Enjoy what you do
and it'll show in your work![END]

=== 31 | 11602 | 7b ===
Hey...that looks like a
mighty rare flying cat![BRK]

Say, why don't you let me
put it in our freak gallery?
It'll make you rich![END]

=== 32 | 1168a | 86 ===
[POR07]
Stop that silly talk this
instant! That's so inhumane
even I wouldn't do it![BRK]

[POR02]
Says who? This girl is
talking about serious money![END]

=== 33 | 11728 | b6 ===
I'm telling you, a few short
months with your cat in the
sideshow,[BRK]

...and we can all retire![BRK]

[POR02]
I don't want to hear you
suggest that again![BRK]

I am not just some dumb
animal, you know![END]

=== 34 | 117ee | d5 ===
I heard a rumor that this
cat is really the actual
Red Dragon![BRK]

If that's true, one week
in the sideshow and we'd
all be able to retire![BRK]

[POR02]
No, no, no! I will not let
you put me on display like,
like some...animal![END]

=== 35 | 118d0 | 98 ===
[POR07]
But Ruby, you are an animal
...in a weird sort of way...[BRK]

Why not turn that gift into
hard cash for all of us?[BRK]

You know, a gift that keeps
on giving![END]

=== 36 | 11978 | 33 ===
This bar has exotic tonics
from all over the world.[END]

=== 37 | 119b8 | 43 ===
Try one of our famous tonics
before you leave. You won't
regret it![END]

=== 38 | 11a0e | 5c ===
Be careful not to order two
different tonics.[BRK]

Some combinations will knock
you on your butt.[END]

=== 39 | 11a7a | 65 ===

I want to go play and see
the carnival sights![END]

=== 3c | 11be6 | 75 ===
Daaad! C'mon! We've got to
go! Jean's the next one up
to dance.[BRK]

People say it's amazing, and
I don't want to miss it![END]

=== 3d | 11c72 | 1a5 ===
Jean? Jean?!! Where are you
going? Is your dance over?[BRK]

Dad you idiot! We missed
Jean's dance! All because of
your stupid drinking![BRK]

I'll never forgive you for
this! Booo hoooo hoooo![BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sorry you missed my
dance because of your
drunken father.[BRK]

I have things to do, but
when I return, I'll dance
just for you! How's that?![BRK]

[POR00]
Really?! Oh, that would be
the greatest![BRK]

Didja hear that, dad? She's
gonna dance just for me![END]

=== 3e | 11e32 | 5d ===
Oh, Jean! I can't wait until
I can see you dance![BRK]

I want to be just like you
when I grow up.[END]

=== 3f | 11e9e | 34 ===
Say, uh, what's a nice girl
like you doing out here?[END]

=== 40 | 11ee6 | 5d ===
You know, these woods are
pretty scary...[BRK]

A girl could get hurt if
she didn't watch her step.[END]

=== 41 | 11f52 | 62 ===
Say there, looks like you
need an escort, honey pie.[BRK]

Come here. I'll take real
good care of you...[END]

=== 42 | 11fc4 | 3f ===
Avoiding bad seeds like
you, buster.[BRK]

Why are all men such pigs?[END]

=== 43 | 12016 | 31 ===
And a boy could get kneed,
if he wasn't careful.[END]

=== 44 | 12056 | 6e ===
Come any closer, and I'll
take permanent care of you,
freak-boy![BRK]

I know your kind, so just
keep your distance![END]

=== 46 | 13544 | 238 ===
[POR00]
...Jean!?[BRK]

What's the matter, Jean?[BRK]

[POR10]
Listen, Giban, I don't have 
time to tell you everything
that's going on right now.[BRK]

In short, Althena's Cult has
blocked the passage to get 
to western Nota and beyond.[BRK]

Giban, I want you to use the
Magic Arrow to fly us to
West Nota.[BRK]

[POR00]
...You can't be serious!?[BRK]

The Magic Arrow has not
been fully tested at that
distance![BRK]

[POR09]
Who's in charge of this
drunken revelry?! Come
forth![BRK]

I am Leo, White Knight of
Althena's Guard. Again,
who is in charge?![BRK]

[POR00]
Oh dear...They've found
you...[BRK]

Don't worry, Jean, I'll take
care of this...[END]

=== 47 | 13786 | 174 ===
[POR09]
You there! I am looking for
a woman that may have passed
through this carnival.[BRK]

She's dressed in an unusual
red cloth. Have you seen 
her?[BRK]

[POR00]
...As you can see, sir, 
we've been here for some
time,[BRK]

but no one that fits your
description passed through
here...[BRK]

[POR09]
I trust that you are telling
the truth...[BRK]

But I warn you. It is not
wise to betray my trust!
Remember that![END]

=== 48 | 138fe | 47 ===
[POR09]
All right, men, search the
area! Leave no stone
unturned![END]

=== 49 | 13948 | 26b ===
[POR10]
...Thank you, Giban. Leo 
is relentless. He wants
Lucia here...[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, you don't have to
thank me.[BRK]

I would hide anybody that
Althena's Guard is 
searching for.[BRK]

I've seen them punish too 
many innocent people. They
have no honor.[BRK]

You know, Lucia is too easy
to spot in that clothing...[BRK]

Jean, why don't you take 
her to the costume tent and
get her some new clothes?[BRK]

[POR08]
New clothes!? But I've
never worn any other![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't worry, Lucia,
I'll help you find
your style...[BRK]

[POR07]
I'll help you too! I love
doing makeovers![BRK]

[POR02]
Don't leave me out! I wanna
help, too![BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, you know where the
costumes are. Help yourself.[END]

=== 4a | 13bca | 7b ===
[POR00]
I'll let you use the Magic
Arrow once Lucia is finished
changing.[BRK]

For now, you'd better stay
close. It's safer that way.[END]

=== 4b | 13c5c | fc ===
[POR00]
...Whoa! Those clothes
really do you justice,
Lucia.[BRK]

I've finished preparing
the Magic Arrow, but you
must ask the old man first.[BRK]

[POR10]
I appreciate your kindness,
Giban. You are truly a good
friend.[BRK]

[POR00]
I am the one that should
be thanking you, Jean.[END]

=== 4c | 13d74 | 4d ===
[POR00]
Don't worry, the Magic Arrow
will take you to your 
destination.[BRK]

I hope...[END]

=== 4d | 13dd4 | 50 ===
[POR00]
Oh! Are you guys okay? [BRK]

Good! If you're not in a
hurry you can rest in 
here.[END]

=== 4e | 13e38 | 5f ===
[POR00]
Jean, I hope you will come
back to us very soon.[BRK]

All of us miss your song
and dance numbers.[END]

=== 4f | 13ea4 | 23 ===
[POR10]
I will return.[BRK]

You have my word.[END]

=== 50 | 13eda | 69 ===
[POR00]
Everyone is singing and
dancing because the world
is at peace.[BRK]

We owe you our eternal
gratitude, Hiro.[END]

=== 51 | 13f5a | 10e ===
[POR00]
Jean, are you leaving
again?[BRK]

[POR10]
I have to. My friends need
my help...[BRK]

[POR00]
You have always placed 
others' well-being ahead
of your own.[BRK]

I hope your friends realize
all the sacrifices you have
made for them.[BRK]

Well, hurry back. You know
that you are always welcome
here.[END]

=== 52 | 14084 | d1 ===
[POR00]
Jean, don't forget that this
carnival is your home and we
are your family...[BRK]

[POR10]
Giban, relax! I'm not going
off to get killed or some-
thing![BRK]

I'll be back before you even
have a chance to start 
missing me![END]

=== 53 | 14168 | 89 ===
[POR05]
...Hey, Hiro, what do you
think they're doing inside
that tent?[BRK]

Look! There's a tear in 
the tent. Waddaya say? Wanna
grab an eyeful?![END]

=== 54 | 141f4 | 52 ===
[POR02]
...Lucia, there's so many
different outfits.[BRK]

Which one are you going to
choose?[END]

=== 55 | 14250 | 152 ===
[POR08]
...I don't care what I
wear...[BRK]

I just must...blend in
better with the local
people here...[BRK]

The type of clothing does
not matter...[BRK]

[POR10]
Come on, Lucia! Of course it
matters. You have to make
a statement with your dress![BRK]

[POR07]
You should choose the most
expensive garments, since
you get them for free!![BRK]

What have you got picked
out...???[END]

=== 56 | 143ac | 145 ===
[POR05]
...Dammit![BRK]

I can't see anything! 
Hiro, let's trade positions![BRK]

[POR01]
In a minute, Ronfar. You
see this stuff everyday! [BRK]

[POR05]
...What!? Hey! Nothing like
this![BRK]

Now move! If I don't get a 
glimpse I'm really going
to be pissed.[BRK]

...Ungh...There...Perfect
view...[BRK]

[POR01]
Ronfar...Let me see![BRK]

[POR05]
...Oh yesss!!! Babydoll,
come to papa![END]

you see when I'm finished!![BRK]

Stop! I said cut it out!![END]

Uh oh!! I think they
heard us...[BRK]

=== 5a | 145c8 | 164 ===
[POR08]
...I'm sorry, Hiro, but did
you want to help me pick out
a new outfit?[BRK]

[POR07]
Lucia, what are you talking
about? Aren't you
embarrassed?[BRK]

These two perverts were
making their own little
peep show![BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....Embarrassed?[BRK]

[POR10]
Lucia, you can't let guys
take advantage of you like
that![BRK]

You have to show 'em who's
boss![BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....Boss?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah, boss! Watch![END]

=== 5b | 14730 | 46 ===
[POR02]
You live with someone all
these years and you think
you know them!![END]

=== 5c | 14780 | 36 ===
[POR10]
Uh, don't do that again.[BRK]

Okay, Lucia...Come on out![END]

=== 5d | 147ba | 5e ===
[POR10]
So whaddaya think of Lucia's
new threads, Hiro?[BRK]

They really enhance her 
charm, don't they?[END]

=== 5e | 14822 | c4 ===
[POR08]
I feel kind of strange...[BRK]

Why are you staring at me
like that, Hiro?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...Is...Is something...
...wrong?[BRK]

[POR01]
Oh, uh...no! No! Everything
is great![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

You look fantastic, Lucia![END]

=== 5f | 148fa | 90 ===
Jean, I haven't seen you 
in ages![BRK]

What? You want to fly to
West Nota using the Magic
Arrow?[BRK]

It's fine with me, but you
need to ask Giban first.[END]

=== 60 | 1499e | ac ===
Giban said you can use the
Arrow...[BRK]

Give me a few minutes to get
everything all set up...[BRK]

Don't worry, you're in good
hands, now. I'll make sure
the Arrow gets you to Nota.[END]

=== 61 | 14a5e | ce ===
The arrow is all finished.[BRK]

Just wait a second while I
make one final adjustment to
the destinationometer...[BRK]

The darned thing's so
touchy...[BRK]

If that thing goes out of
whack, no tellin' where
you'll end up...[END]

=== 62 | 14b36 | 34 ===
...All right, who's going to
be the first to get in?[END]

=== 63 | 14b6e | 4b ===
[POR09]
I knew the old man was
lying![BRK]

...Halt! I've finally found
you, traitors![END]

=== 64 | 14bbc | 39 ===
[POR05]
...Come on! Hurry up and
get in! Let's get outta
here![END]

=== 65 | 14bf8 | 4b ===
[POR09]
...Ha!! Do you really think
you can escape me!?[BRK]

...Guess again, vermin!![END]

=== 66 | 14c46 | 55 ===
[ROR09]
Enjoy your little flight.[BRK]

I'm afraid your itinerary
has changed...[BRK]

Ha ha ha ha ha![END]

=== 67 | 14cb6 | 94 ===
...I heard you didn't have
a pleasant time flying the
Magic Arrow.[BRK]

Well, don't blame me! Leo's
the one responsible for the
change of flight plans![END]

=== 68 | 14d58 | 95 ===
I think I can build a better
Arrow. I just need someone
to test it out...[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sorry, but after the
last time, no one here is
ready to volunteer...[END]

=== 69 | 14e08 | 9e ===
If I just would've taken the 
expansion shield and crossed
it over to the...[BRK]

...Don't worry, I'll have
the bugs worked out of the 
new one before you need it.[END]

=== 6a | 14eba | ca ===
J-42 to J-37. The black wire
then crosses over and hooks
on to yellow J-29.[BRK]

Yikes! Geez, don't just walk
up and scare me like that![BRK]

I'm working hard to finish
the new Magic Arrow so you
guys can fly it.[END]

=== 6b | 14f92 | 5a ===
[POR10]
I've told you a million 
times, we're not going to 
fly on your Magic Arrows![BRK]

...Ever![END]

=== 6c | 15004 | 86 ===
Say, you don't know anyone
that would like to take
a Magic Arrow ride?[BRK]

I need a guinea pi...I
mean to say, volunteer...
to try it out.[END]

=== 6d | 1509e | 83 ===
Geez, if Lucia wanted to buy
a dress, she should've come
to my shop first.[BRK]

Next time just make sure
you check my store first,
okay?[END]

=== 6e | 15126 | 79 ===
With all the travelin' 
I've done, I got some pretty
cool stuff![BRK]

I buy and sell almost
everything. What can I do
for you?[END]

=== 6f | 151a8 | 22 ===
Just remember to come to
me first![END]

=== 70 | 151da | ab ===
Please step back. Don't 
you know who you are talking
to?[BRK]

I'm the most famous star of
this carnival.[BRK]

I just can't go outside 
anymore because the women 
keep attacking me![END]

=== 71 | 15292 | 3f ===
[POR05]
Hey, I hear ya, buddy.[BRK]

I have to beat 'em back with
a stick![END]

=== 72 | 152de | 53 ===
[POR02]
What are you talking about,
Ronfar? Usually the women
are running away from you.[END]

=== 73 | 1534c | 88 ===
Oh, I just don't know
what to do![BRK]

I guess I need to hire some
bodyguards to keep my fans
away from me.[BRK]

Being a celebrity sure does
suck![END]

=== 74 | 153e2 | 11 ===
[POR05]
Amen, brother![END]

=== 75 | 1540e | 7d ===
I'm in the middle of 
answering all my fan mail.[BRK]

I really need to get a 
secretary so that she can
take care of this for me.[END]

=== 76 | 1549e | a1 ===
I give and I give and it's
just not good enough for 
you people.[BRK]

What more do you want from
me?[BRK]

Just go! It'll never be good
enough for you anyway...
Leave me...[END]

=== 77 | 15556 | 76 ===
Hey, do you think I could 
have your cat? [BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro, you're not seriously
thinking about letting him 
have me, are you?[END]

=== 78 | 155e0 | 66 ===
I have taught all the great
dancers of the world.[BRK]

My latest protege is Jean.[BRK]

I see that you've met...[END]

=== 79 | 1565e | 30 ===
I'm sorry, but I can't 
accept any new students.[END]

=== 7a | 156a2 | 7c ===
Oh dear! Why is Leo after
Jean? Is she in some sort
of trouble?[BRK]

This is terrible! My star
pupil...wanted by Althena's
Guard![END]

=== 7b | 15736 | af ===
Don't forget to practice
your dancing every day,
Jean.[BRK]

If you miss just one
practice, your skills will
start to fade.[BRK]

[POR10]
I know, practice makes 
perfect, blah, blah, blah...[END]

=== 7c | 157fc | 32 ===
Oh!? You guys...
What's...What's happened
to Jean?[END]

=== 7d | 15846 | cd ===
Love the new outfit, Jean!
I think it really makes
you look hot![BRK]

Maybe when you come back,
you can teach me karate.[BRK]

Then I can be a karate and
dance expert, and I can 
raise my rates. [BRK]

[POR10]
Uh, yeah...right.[END]

=== 7e | 1592a | 4d ===
Since Jean has become 
famous, my dancing school
has become full of students.[END]

=== 7f | 1598a | 98 ===
After one lesson of karate
with Jean, I stopped taking
lessons from her.[BRK]

I got tired of her kicking
the snot out of me. I think
I'll stick to dancing...[END]

=== 80 | 15a36 | 89 ===
Jean!? Are you going back
on the road with your 
friends?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah, it's time that we
finally bring an end to
this chapter of Hiro's life.[END]

=== 81 | 15ad2 | 9c ===
I'm the best dancer in this
whole place. I've never met
my equal.[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sure you've worked hard
to become so. Have you seen
me dance?[BRK]

...Just wondering...[END]

=== 82 | 15b86 | a2 ===
I just won the world
dancing competition...[BRK]

Some of the people say I
only won because Jean wasn't
able to attend...[BRK]

[POR10]
Enjoy the victory. You
earned it, I'm sure.[END]

=== 83 | 15c3c | 54 ===
Lord Leo certainly seemed
to be agitated![BRK]

What's the big deal? It's
just one girl...[END]

=== 84 | 15ca8 | ac ===
I've heard that you won't
be coming back for a
while...[BRK]

That's too bad. I guess
everyone will have to enjoy
my dancing.[BRK]

[POR10]
Just keep them entertained
until I get back![END]

=== 85 | 15d6c | 63 ===
Jean, you seem to be
totally, like, happy.[BRK]

Did you get some?[BRK]

You know, just between
you and me...[END]

=== 86 | 15dea | a3 ===
Jean, what's this new
outfit?[BRK]

Does this mean that you're
going to give up dancing
for good?[BRK]

[POR10]
No, no. I'm only doing this
temporarily. I'll be back
to dance soon.[END]

=== 87 | 15eac | 41 ===
I just can't find my way. I
don't know what life has to
offer me.[END]

=== 88 | 15f18 | 85 ===
I've been dancing my legs
off and all I keep hearing
is how great Jean is.[BRK]

Don't walk away from me,
Jean! We have a score to
settle.[END]

=== 89 | 15fb0 | b4 ===
Jeeeaaannn...
have you finally returned
to dance?[BRK]

It's about time we see who
the best dancer is in this
carnival.[BRK]

[POR10]
No! I'm just getting ready 
to leave again. I'll see you
later![END]

=== 8a | 1607c | 1f1 ===
[POR10]
You came back, just like
you promised![BRK]

[POR02]
Jean, I always thought
you looked best dressed
as a dancer.[BRK]

[POR10]
Thanks, Ruby. I like being
a dancer. Say, where's
Lucia?[BRK]

After all, I did promise her
that I would do a dance for
her once we defeated Zophar.[BRK]

What's wrong with Hiro? His
eyes seem so...distant, so
...lost...[BRK]

What!? Lucia went back to
the Blue Star without Hiro?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Hiro, are you sure you want
to go to the Blue Star?[BRK]

Well, you know you can
always count on me! Do
you want my help?[END]

=== 8b | 16270 | 34 ===
[0x5]No, I'll do it myself.
Yes, Jean, I need your help.[END]

=== 8c | 162b4 | ae ===
[POR10]
Okay, if that's how you
feel, Hiro. But I'm ready
to help any time![BRK]

After all, you helped me
defeat Lunn and put an end
to the Blue Dragon Cult.[BRK]

Come on, let me help you.[END]

=== 8d | 16378 | 7f ===
[POR10]
All right!! This is going to
be just like old times.[BRK]

Excuse me while I go put
on something a little
bit more appropriate...[END]

=== 8e | 1640a | a1 ===
[POR10]
Guess I shouldn't have said
I'd never use karate again,
eh?[BRK]

But this is kind of a
special case.[BRK]

We've got to find a way for
you to get back to the Blue
Star![END]

=== 8f | 164c6 | 95 ===
[POR10]
Hiro, stop your complaining!
I already told you I'm
willing to help![BRK]

Are you just going to sit 
there and act stupid? [BRK]

Do you want my help or
not?[END]

North Carnival [END]

=== 91 | 170ae | 14 ===
Hmmm...Where's Jean?[END]

=== 92 | 170da | d9 ===
Ahh! Hey, there's Jean!
Say, Jean, have you come
back to join the carnival?[BRK]

[POR10]
No, no. I just stopped by
for a visit. I still have
other things to do.[BRK]

[POR00]
Shucks, that sucks. We want
you to come back and dance
with us![END]

=== 93 | 171ce | 2f ===
I wish you didn't have to
leave us again, Jean.[END]

=== 94 | 17210 | 6e ===
I saw you guys fly in the
Magic Arrow! It was sooo
cool![BRK]

...But weren't you afraid?
It was so high in the air![END]

=== 95 | 1728c | 2d ===
[POR10]
Me? Afraid? Naaah. It was a
piece of cake![END]

=== 96 | 172d0 | b8 ===
Wow Jean, that karate suit
really makes you look
dangerous.[BRK]

Do you think you can teach
me Blue Dragon Karate some-
day?[BRK]

[POR10]
Sure. I'd be happy to teach
you the Way of the Blue
Dragon...[END]

=== 97 | 173b4 | b5 ===
It's sooo cool that Jean
has come back![BRK]

She teaches me karate every
day after she finishes her
dance.[BRK]

Pretty soon, I'll be big and
strong enough to protect
everyone in the carnival![END]

=== 98 | 1747c | 6b ===
I'll keep practicing the
things you taught me, Jean![BRK]

[POR10]
Keep it up. You're going to
be very strong someday![END]

=== 99 | 174fa | 5e ===
Don't bother me! I'm
practicing my new dance![BRK]

Even Jean will not be
able to best me this time![END]

=== 9a | 1756c | 93 ===
J-Jean! You came to the
carnival! Are you still
keeping up on your dance?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes. I have a new step that
I'll show you when I rejoin
the carnival.[END]

=== 9b | 17612 | a0 ===
I watched as you guys got
to ride the Magic Arrow.[BRK]

It seemed to go so high!
I was afraid you might not
survive.[BRK]

Especially since Lord Leo
changed it all around![END]

=== 9c | 176ce | 8f ===
Jean?! What are you doing
in a karate suit?[BRK]

Have you...given up
dancing?[BRK]

[POR10]
No, I just have to help
a friend...I'll be back here
in no time...[END]

=== 9d | 1777c | 8d ===
Honestly, Jean, I've never
seen you in better shape.[BRK]

[POR10]
I've been practicing my
karate and doing something
new called 'aerobics.'[END]

=== 9e | 17820 | 3b ===
I really miss having the
competition between me and
Jean...[END]

=== 9f | 1786e | c8 ===
I'm glad Jean's back now,
but I also worry that she's
become a better dancer.[BRK]

Oh no! What will happen to
me if she has improved her
dance skills?!![BRK]

I'll be dead meat! No one
will want to see me dance![END]

=== a0 | 1794a | 76 ===
Jean, these days your face
is always flushed. Are you
sick?[BRK]

[POR10]
I think I may be lovesick.[BRK]

[POR00]
You don't say...Hmmmm...[END]

=== a1 | 179d4 | 7e ===
Jean...Oh, my dear, sweet
Jean...I know she's crazy
for me...[BRK]

...but she cannot express
her love for me because she
is so shy.[END]

=== a2 | 17a6a | dc ===
Ah, my sweet moncherie.
You have come back to your
one true love.[BRK]

I have waited for you to
return so that we can fan
the flames of our passion![BRK]

[POR10]
Uh, sorry to squirt on your
fire, but we weren't even
friends, remember?[END]

=== a3 | 17b62 | b6 ===
My sweet Jean, come into my
waiting arms and return to
the love we once knew...[BRK]

[POR10]
Love we once knew? I think
you're thinking about that
doll in your closet...[BRK]

We were never in love.[END]

=== a4 | 17c30 | d8 ===
Jean, Jean, Jean! Do not
tear my beating heart from
this tender flesh![BRK]

Come back to me now...All
is forgiven...Be mine yet
once more.[BRK]

[POR10]
Buddy, I think you should be
in the market for some
serious psychiatric help...[END]

=== a5 | 17d3c | a4 ===
Sweet, sweet flower! Come!
Enter my willing embrace and
know the love of eternity.[BRK]

[POR10]
Don't you mean the nut of
eternity? Sorry, this sweet
flower's not interested.[END]

=== a6 | 17e00 | 95 ===
Jean, Jean, why do you deny
our love? My heart lies
crushed and bleeding...[BRK]

[POR10]
It's better than the fat lip
you'll get if you keep this
up, buster...[END]

=== a7 | 17eac | bb ===
Has Jean gone away to hide
from my affection?[BRK]

Tell me where she is, so
that I may tell her of my
love once more...[BRK]

[POR02]
Man, talk about out of
touch with reality! This
guy takes the cake![END]

=== a8 | 17f7a | 79 ===
My love Jean keeps coming
back here to be near me...[BRK]

I know that a secret flame
burns in her heart for me
and me alone...[END]

Jean, sweet Jean...Why do
you let our love run cold?[BRK]

I will love you until the
end of time, and yet my
love goes unrequited...[BRK]

Come near to me and I will

Mirrors, mirrors 'round your

Mirrors, mirrors will take

Pick your side and step on
in. Then take a chance to
go again.[END]

If one side does not make

Remember this. Now listen
close...There is a mirror

Try it, try it! Fun it is.
You might get rich if you

No...No! I see the brave one

What's the matter, Jean?[BRK]

Listen, Giban, I don't have 
time to tell you everything
that's going on right now.[BRK]

In short, Althena's Cult has
blocked the passage to get 
to western Nota and beyond.[BRK]

Giban, I want you to use the
Magic Arrow to fly us to
West Nota.[BRK]

[POR00]
...You can't be serious!?[BRK]

The Magic Arrow has not
been fully tested at that
distance![BRK]

[POR09]
Who's in charge of this
drunken revelry?! Come
forth![BRK]

I am Leo, White Knight of
Althena's Guard. Again,
who is in charge?![BRK]

[POR00]
Oh dear...They've found
you...[BRK]

Don't worry, Jean, I'll take
care of this.[END]

You there! I am looking for
a woman that may have passed
through this carnival.[BRK]

She's dressed in an unusual
red cloth. Have you seen 
her?[BRK]

[POR00]
...As you can see, sir, 
we've been here for some
time,[BRK]

but no one that fits your
description passed through
here...[BRK]

[POR09]
I trust that you are telling
the truth...[BRK]

But I warn you: It is not
wise to betray my trust!
Remember that![END]

[POR09]
All right, men, search the
area! Leave no stone
unturned![END]

=== 108 | 1dd2e | 26b ===
[POR10]
Thank you, Giban. Leo 
is relentless. He wants
Lucia here...[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, you don't have to
thank me.[BRK]

I would hide anybody that
Althena's Guard is 
searching for.[BRK]

I've seen them punish too 
many innocent people. They
have no honor...[BRK]

You know, Lucia is too easy
to spot in that clothing...[BRK]

Jean, why don't you take 
her to the costume tent and
get her some new clothes?[BRK]

[POR08]
New clothes!? But I've
never worn any other![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't worry, Lucia,
I'll help you find
your style...[BRK]

[POR07]
I'll help you too! I love
doing makeovers![BRK]

[POR02]
Don't leave me out! I wanna
help, too![BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, you know where the
costumes are. Help yourself.[END]

I'll let you use the Magic
Arrow once Lucia is finished
changing.[BRK]

For now, you'd better stay
close. It's safer that way.[END]

really do you justice,
Lucia.[BRK]

I've finished preparing

Giban. You are truly a good
friend.[BRK]

I am the one that should
be thanking you, Jean.[END]

You have always placed
others' well-being ahead
of your own.[BRK]

all the sacrifices you have
made for them.[BRK]

Well, hurry back. You know

missing me![END]

The type of clothing does
not matter...[BRK]

[POR10]
Come on, Lucia! Of course it
matters. You have to make
a statement with your dress![BRK]

You should choose the most
expensive garments, since
you get them for free!![BRK]

Now move! If I don't get a

These two perverts were
making their own little
peep show![BRK]

[POR08]

.....Embarrassed?[BRK]

[POR10]
Lucia, you can't let guys
take advantage of you like

You have to show 'em who's

It's fine with me, but you
need to ask Giban first.[END]

I think it really makes

Maybe when you come back,

Then I can be a karate and
dance expert, and I can 
raise my rates. [BRK]

on the road with your 
friends?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah. It's time that we
finally bring an end to
this chapter of Hiro's life.[END]

=== 140 | 1feb8 | 9c ===
I'm the best dancer in this
whole place. I've never met
my equal.[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sure you've worked hard
to become so. Have you seen
me dance?[BRK]

...Just wondering...[END]

=== 141 | 1ff6c | a2 ===
I just won the world
dancing competition...[BRK]

Some of the people say I
only won because Jean wasn't
able to attend...[BRK]

[POR10]
Enjoy the victory. You
earned it, I'm sure.[END]

=== 142 | 20022 | 54 ===
Lord Leo certainly seemed
to be agitated![BRK]

What's the big deal? It's
just one girl...[END]

=== 143 | 2008e | ac ===
I've heard that you won't be
coming back for a while...[BRK]

That's too bad. I guess 
everyone will have to enjoy
my dancing.[BRK]

[POR10]
Just keep them entertained
until I get back![END]

=== 144 | 20152 | 63 ===
Jean, you seem to be
totally, like, happy.[BRK]

Did you get some?[BRK]

You know, just between you
and me...[END]

=== 145 | 201d0 | a3 ===
Jean, what's this new
outfit?[BRK]

Does this mean that you're
going to give up dancing
for good?[BRK]

[POR10]
No, no. I'm only doing this
temporarily. I'll be back
to dance soon.[END]

=== 146 | 20292 | 41 ===
I just can't find my way. I
don't know what life has to
offer me.[END]

=== 147 | 202fe | 85 ===
I've been dancing my legs
off and all I hear is how
great Jean is...[BRK]

Don't walk away from me,
Jean! We have a score to
settle.[END]

=== 148 | 20396 | b4 ===
Jeeeaaannn...
have you finally returned
to dance?[BRK]

It's about time we see who
the best dancer is in this
carnival.[BRK]

[POR10]
No! I'm just getting ready 
to leave again. I'll see you
later![END]

=== 149 | 20462 | 1f1 ===
[POR10]
You came back, just like
you promised![BRK]

[POR02]
Jean, I always thought
you looked best dressed
as a dancer.[BRK]

[POR10]
Thanks, Ruby. I like being
a dancer. Say, where's
Lucia?[BRK]

After all, I did promise her
that I would do a dance for
her once we defeated Zophar.[BRK]

What's wrong with Hiro? His
eyes seem so...distant, so
...lost...[BRK]

What!? Lucia went back to
the Blue Star without Hiro?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Hiro, are you sure you want
to go to the Blue Star?[BRK]

Well, you know you can
always count on me! Do
you want my help?[END]

=== 14a | 20656 | 34 ===
[0x5]No, I'll do it myself.
Yes, Jean, I need your help.[END]

=== 14b | 2069a | ae ===
[POR10]
Okay, if that's how you
feel, Hiro. But I'm ready
to help any time![BRK]

After all, you helped me
defeat Lunn and put an end
to the Blue Dragon Cult.[BRK]

Come on, let me help you.[END]

=== 14c | 2075e | 7f ===
[POR10]
All right!! This is going to
be just like old times.[BRK]

Excuse me while I go put
on something a little
bit more appropriate...[END]

=== 14d | 207f0 | a1 ===
[POR10]
Guess I shouldn't have said
I'd never use karate again,
eh?[BRK]

But this is kind of a
special case.[BRK]

We've got to find a way for
you to get back to the Blue
Star![END]

=== 14e | 208ac | 95 ===
[POR10]
Hiro, stop your complaining!
I already told you I'm
willing to help![BRK]

Are you just going to sit 
there and act stupid? [BRK]

Do you want my help or
not?[END]

=== 14f | 2094a | f ===
North Carnival [END]
