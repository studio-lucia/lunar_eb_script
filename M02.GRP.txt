I'll find that girl for the
Goddess, if it's the last
thing I do![BRK]

We won't allow her to ruin
all we've built![END]

=== 5 | 10d72 | 9e ===
Lord Leo, you certainly
look splendid today, if I
might offer my opinion.[BRK]

I don't usually say that
to guys, you know...[BRK]

You know...the oath, and
all that...[END]

Gave 10s.[END]

[POR05]
Okay. Now then, everything
is set to break the spell
on Lucia.[BRK]

Goddess Althena, hear my
plea...Take your holy light
and cleanse this girl.[BRK]

Loose the bonds that now
bind the mind and heart of
this tortured soul.[BRK]

Shatter the darkness with
rays of holy light!!![END]

=== 9 | 10f98 | dd ===
[POR08]
Uuu...Aaaahhhh![BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar! What's wrong? 
Lucia's in agony![BRK]

[POR05]
This is impossible! The
spell she's under is 
stronger than...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I-I've never failed to 
break a spell, except once
when...[BRK]

....Mauri was sick...[END]

=== a | 1107e | 92 ===
[POR05]
Ohhhh....yes! I-It worked![BRK]

...Sweet success at the
hands of Ronfar![BRK]

It's not complete, but the
main spell is broken. She'll
just have to...[END]

=== b | 1111a | fc ===
Oh! I didn't know anyone
was still in here.[BRK]

Yes, well, the sanctuary is
closed for the day. Come 
back tomorrow...[BRK]

[POR05]
No thanks, old man. I don't
have any need to come back
to this place.[BRK]

Lucia, you can rest at my 
house with your friends. 
Let's go...[END]

=== c | 11234 | 39 ===
Are you still trying to
break the curse on the
poor girl?[END]

=== d | 11270 | 60 ===
The Goddess is good to those
that serve her well...[BRK]

[POR02]
Especially if they donate in
cash, right?[END]

=== e | 112e8 | 5e ===
Please donate your spare
money to the sanctuary. [BRK]

Althena will reward your
generosity someday.[END]

=== f | 1135a | b6 ===
The sanctuary is still
closed for the day.[BRK]

Please come back later.[BRK]

[POR05]
C'mon, Hiro. Let's go to
my house and let Lucia 
rest.[BRK]

She's had a really tough
time, and I'm sure she needs
it.[END]

=== 10 | 11438 | 88 ===
Thanks be to Althena, the
Goddess from which all
goodness springs forth...[BRK]

But goodness has a price to
be paid...Donate now, won't
you?[END]

=== 11 | 114e4 | 74 ===
I now know that the Goddess
cannot fix all of mankind's
mistakes.[BRK]

We must take responsibility
for our own actions...[END]

=== 12 | 11568 | 8a ===
The most important thing we
all must possess is a
willing spirit.[BRK]

The Goddess will not help
those that are not willing
to help themselves.[END]

=== 13 | 11606 | c4 ===
You're looking for the girl
with red clothes?[BRK]

If you pray to Althena, and
your heart is true, she will
show you the way, I'm sure.[BRK]

The best way to show that
your heart is true is to
donate freely.[END]

=== 14 | 116de | 9d ===
The people of this town
are deserving only of
Althena's wrath![BRK]

All they want to do is
gamble their lives away![BRK]

And they never donate any
of their winnings...[END]

=== 15 | 1178a | 72 ===
We've worked so hard to
build a peaceful, loving
world here.[BRK]

But it's come so close to
destruction so many
times![END]

=== 16 | 1180a | 53 ===
[POR09]
As long as the Goddess is
yet with us, Zophar will not
accomplish his evil here.[END]

=== 17 | 11870 | 129 ===
Ah, yes. I sense that the
girl in the red robe is
fading from us.[BRK]

Quick, donate to Althena
and pray for her mercy.[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, I really don't think
that's gonna work...[BRK]

Say, do you happen to
know a priest named Ronfar?[BRK]

[POR00]
Priest?!? Ronfar is no
priest!![BRK]

He has traded his calling
for implements of sin.[END]

=== 18 | 119b0 | 4b ===
That miserable failure,
Ronfar, could have been the
greatest priest of all.[END]

=== 19 | 11a22 | 5e ===
Our world now careens toward
destruction...[BRK]

Only the Goddess Althena has
the power to save us.[END]

=== 1a | 11a90 | 42 ===
I can't believe that our
world was saved from the
brink by humans.[END]

=== 1b | 11ae0 | 49 ===
[POR05]
Now you can get to more
important jobs...like
learning to shoot craps![END]

=== 1c | 11b38 | 70 ===
These miserable souls do
not understand the danger
our world is in.[BRK]

If they did, they'd be
crying like babies...[END]

=== 1d | 11bbc | 77 ===
Lucia? No, I can't say that
I know of her.[BRK]

Say, can I interest you in
becoming a member of the
Sanctuary Boosters Club?[END]

=== 1e | 11c56 | bc ===
Say, can I cut you a deal
on a slightly used Althena
statue?[BRK]

They make great hall trees!
Attractive and functional.[BRK]

With the world going to hell
in a handbasket, we don't
need 'em anymore.[END]

=== 1f | 11d20 | 78 ===
[POR05]
Say there, sis, don't beat
yourself up about it.[BRK]

Trot on over to the bar and
forget your worries over a
cold one![END]

=== 20 | 11dac | 74 ===
Since the Goddess Althena
herself resides in Penta-
gulia, [BRK]

only specially chosen ones
may enter its hallowed
halls.[END]

=== 21 | 11e2e | 30 ===
[POR08]
...Althena resides in...
Pentagulia...Hmm...[END]

=== 22 | 11e62 | 3f ===
I'm dreaming of the day I am
chosen to serve in Penta-
gulia...[END]

=== 23 | 11eb8 | 6c ===
There's a rumor floating
around about that dog
Ronfar.[BRK]

They say he's been learning
new tricks in Pentagulia![END]

=== 24 | 11f32 | 75 ===
[POR05]
Hrmph! Well, it's not true,
but I kinda like the sound
of it.[BRK]

Kinda enhances my special
mystique, don't you think?[END]

=== 25 | 11fbe | d7 ===
Huh? A girl wearing a red
dress? No, I haven't seen
her.[BRK]

But rather than chasing
skirts, why not repent from
your sins and serve Althena?[BRK]

[POR05]
Done it, seen it, been it.
Sorry, no dice...[BRK]

Uh, pardon the pun...Hahaha![END]

=== 26 | 120b8 | 6c ===
If Zophar had succeeded,
our world would have been
lost forever![BRK]

Thank heavens for the
heroes that saved us![END]

=== 27 | 12134 | 47 ===
If you offer your Silver
to the Goddess Althena, 
you will grow strong.[END]

=== 28 | 1218e | a4 ===
Some of the village folk
give to the sanctuary,[BRK]

but most are heathen pigs
who will wither in the hot
fires of Althena's fury.[BRK]

At least, I'm pretty sure
they will...[END]

=== 29 | 12242 | 6f ===
You can ask Althena to do
anything on your behalf.[BRK]

But it's really just good
manners to donate something,
too.[END]

=== 2a | 122ca | 7e ===
We are the guardians of
Althena's truth.[BRK]

Through us, the world will
come to know Althena's
goodness.[BRK]

...If they donate enough.[END]

=== 2b | 1234c | 69 ===
But in all this time, we
have not made even one
person here convert![BRK]

This town is crawlin' with
sinners![END]

=== 2c | 123cc | ad ===
Lucia...Lucia...hmm...[BRK]

I have heard that name once
before. I think Lord Leo was
trying to find her.[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh no! I don't like the
sound of that one bit! We've
got to find her![END]

=== 2d | 1248c | 88 ===
I was thinking of starting
a bingo tournament to pack
this place.[BRK]

Do you think it'll work?
Of course, all proceeds will
go to Althena...[END]

=== 2e | 12522 | 8a ===
[POR05]
Hey, that sounds like just
the ticket to get the 
sinners in here![BRK]

Come right down to their
level. At least, that's
what I always said.[END]

=== 2f | 125c6 | 32 ===
What ever happened to the
carefree days of before?[END]

=== 30 | 125fc | 79 ===
If there's one thing I've
learned through all of this,
it's this:[BRK]

Believe in yourself and all
your dreams will come true.[END]

=== 31 | 1267e | f ===
Larpa Sanctuary[END]
