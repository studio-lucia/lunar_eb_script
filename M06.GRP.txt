...hmmm? What's wrong with
Lucia? She seems to be...
hesitating...[BRK]

Hiro, I don't think she's
human...her magic is too
strong.[BRK]

Perhaps she is a destroyer,
as Lord Leo said. But why
would she come here?[BRK]

Hrmph! Fiddle, m'boy...it 
makes no sense...no sense at
all...

[END]

=== 1 | 9baa | 87 ===
[POR04]
Well, that seals it, m'boy.
She's definitely not human.[BRK]

'Least not like any other
I've known. But I can't
believe she's a destroyer.[END]

[POR02]
Hiro...where are you going?
You can't leave without
Lucia and Grandpa Gwyn![END]

=== 3 | 9cb2 | bc ===
[POR02]
What was Zophar talking...
and Lucia...ohh![BRK]

Hiro, I'm scared. This is
too big for us. We don't
belong in this struggle.[BRK]

If only we hadn't taken
that Dragon Eye Jewel from
the ruins...

[END]

=== 4 | 9d86 | db ===
[POR04]
Lucia says she came from
the Blue Star. But did
she say why?[BRK]

[POR02]
She came here to meet the
Goddess Althena![BRK]

[POR04]
Goddess Althena? You mean
the one that the Cultists
serve?[BRK]

I can't believe that it
could be the same one.
[END]

=== 5 | 9e6a | 64 ===
[POR08]
Althena...I sense her power,
but cannot detect her
presence here.[BRK]

I must find out where she
is...[END]

=== 6 | 9ed8 | 25b ===
[POR02]
Hiro...tell me I'm having a
bad dream....wake me up...[BRK]

Please![BRK]

[POR04]
It's no dream, Ruby. These
are strange goings-on....
strange, indeed.[BRK]

Hmm, yes. It seems that this
Zophar fellow has cursed her
very soul.[BRK]

If we don't break the spell,
she'll most certainly die.[BRK]

[POR08]
Unghh...i...have...to...
...Althena...before...
...unghhhh...[BRK]

[POR04]
Young lady, save your
strength. You can tell us
all about it later.[BRK]

[POR08]
But...time is...I must...
...only Althena can...
..Zophar...unnghhh...[BRK]

[POR04]
Come, Hiro. We've got to get
her back to the house.[BRK]

Maybe one of my books will
give us a clue about how to
break this curse...[END]

[POR04]
Hmmmmm...[BRK]

I never thought I'd get to
see the Blue Spire this
close.[BRK]

It seems my research is
about to pay off...[BRK]

[POR02]
Let's hope you've learned
all there is to know about
what we might find![END]

Hey, you slackers! What
are you waiting around for?[END]

=== 9 | a26a | ca ===
[POR02]
Nall![BRK]

[POR11]
Time is short. If we don't
hurry, Zophar will return!
We must go to Pentagulia.[BRK]

The blue and Black Dragons   
are waiting near there. [BRK]

We have to attack while
Zophar is still weak.[BRK]

Let's go![END]

[POR04]
Ah, m'boy, we've arrived at
the seventh floor of the
Spire.[BRK]

The ancient writings speak
of a secret way to the top
floor somewhere in here.[BRK]

We must search this room
thoroughly to find it.[END]

=== 17 | d69a | 22c ===
[POR04]
Bah! Oh! Confound it all,
son! Don't scare me like
that![BRK]

You had me beside myself
with worry, young man![BRK]

I've been looking all over
for you! Where in tarnation
did you go?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...oh dear! Who's this
you've found?[BRK]

[POR02]
Her name is Lucia. We found
her in a room with a big
crystal jewel![BRK]

And guess what, Grandpa
Gwyn! She's from the Blue
Star![BRK]

[POR04]
By Althena herself! A girl
has traveled to us from
the Blue Star!?[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR04]
Hiro, we've got to get out
of here.[BRK]

If Leo finds her, we're in
big trouble, and so is she.
We'll talk later...let's go![END]

=== 18 | d8e2 | 95 ===
[POR04]
There's got to be a way
to the top floor from
this room, lad.[BRK]

We just have to look harder
to find it.[BRK]

Examine everything! Leave no
stone unturned![END]

=== 19 | d98a | 4a ===
[POR02]
Whoa, Hiro! Look at that!
I bet this is the place
Grandpa talked about.[END]

=== 1a | d9ec | 5f ===
[POR02]
Hmmm...nothing is happening
this time. But last time,
it...[BRK]

Maybe it doesn't work
anymore...[END]

H-hiro...I don't think
we're in kansas anymore...[BRK]

I...i...think this must be
the secret room Grandpa
was talking about![BRK]

I hope that destroyer Leo's
looking for isn't lurking
around here...[BRK]

[POR01]
Althena? You mean the
Goddess Althena?[BRK]

I don't know if I can help
you, but I'm willing to
try![BRK]

[POR08]
Who are you?[BRK]

[POR01]
Oh...sorry, I'm Hiro.
And, uh, that's Ruby.[BRK]

[POR02]
In the flesh...[BRK]

[POR08]
If you are residents of this
world, you must help me find
the Goddess Althena.[BRK]

It's urgent that I find her.
The fate of your world hangs
in the balance.[END]

[POR02]
Whoa! This is fantastic!
I've never seen anything
like it![BRK]

[POR08]
This has been collecting the
magic of your world for many
thousands of years.[BRK]

The power it collected was
to be used to restore the
Blue Star someday.[BRK]

...and restoring the Blue
Star is the reason for my
being.[BRK]

[POR02]
You mean your whole life is
dedicated to restoring the
Blue Star?[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

If we use some of the power
that's collected here, it
should revive Hiro.[BRK]

I'll transport him to the
center of the circle.

L...Lucia? Where...where
am i? What is thi...this
place?[BRK]

[POR08]
Hiro?! Oh Hiro! You're alive
again![BRK]

[POR02]
You had us all worried there
for a while![BRK]

[POR05]
Ya got eight lives left,
kiddo.[BRK]

[POR10]
Whew! I was scared this
wouldn't work and we'd have
to face Zophar alone![BRK]

[POR07]
We would have paid almost
anything to get you back![BRK]

[POR08]
Now that Hiro is restored,
we must go to Pentagulia
immediately![BRK]

Zophar may already have
the power of Althena![END]
