Um, i don't think this door
is going to budge.[BRK]

It's locked tight.[END]

My dear ronfar, why have
you come all this way to
see me?[BRK]

There is nothing left to
discuss. Our love has
grown cold.[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR05]
Oh, mauri! Don't say that![BRK]

I've been running from my
true self. I realized some
things when i last saw you.[BRK]

I realized that i can't live
without you...that i need
you in my life.[BRK]

But we have to find a way to
free you from this evil
spell you're under.[BRK]

[POR15]
But ronfar, i am this way
because of you.[BRK]

Don't you see? We can never
go back...[END]

Lady mauri hasn't been
herself lately.[BRK]

It seems that she's being 
haunted by strange dreams 
during the night.[BRK]

She keeps saying that it
feels as if she's dying
inside.[BRK]

I'm worried...[END]

=== 3 | 1812c | a9 ===
Have you noticed that even
when mauri smiles, you can
see the pain in her eyes?[BRK]

In the past, she used to
be so carefree, but now
she's just so...so...[BRK]

.........empty....[END]

Lord leo and lady mauri have
devoted their lives to 
further althena's cause.[BRK]

But ever since lord leo was
granted the destiny, he
never sees mauri anymore.
[END]

=== 5 | 1827c | a2 ===
Rumor has it that lady
mauri has been granted the
power of the red dragon.[BRK]

That's why she can throw
fire at will.[BRK]

[POR02]
Ha! That's nothing compared
to what i can do![END]

I've just heard everything
that you were talking about.[BRK]

I will keep the fact that
you have escaped a secret
from the cult.[BRK]

I must find out what is
really happening with the
goddess.[BRK]

In any case, we must find 
lucia and hear her story.[BRK]

So then, our first stop
should be the shrine where
she's being held.[BRK]

We can get there by means
of the underground passage
below this tower.[BRK]

I will go with you, and
together we will get to the
bottom of this mystery.[BRK]

[POR05]
....
.....[BRK]

<Wink> uh, don't ya mean
'bottom of this mystere?'[BRK]

...psst! Say old buddy,
where'd ya stash your
mask?[BRK]

[POR09]
Are you drunk, ronfar?
I have no disguise stashed![BRK]

Why would i have a disguise?[END]

[POR05]
Man, i thought the calvary
would never get here![BRK]

I can't tell ya how glad
i am to see you guys![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...uh, hey leo, what's with
the mask?[BRK]

[POR02]
He's pretending to be some
kind of supernut called
'mystere.'[BRK]

Go figure...[BRK]

[POR05]
Ha ha ha! Okay, then,
mystere it is...[BRK]

Now then, get a load of
this...i'm in a serious load
of poo-poo...[END]

Oh mauri! Don't say that![BRK]

I've been running from my
true self. I realized some

I realized that i can't live
without you...that i need
you in my life.[BRK]

But we have to find a way to
free you from this evil
spell you're under.[BRK]

[POR15]
But ronfar...i am this way
because of you.[BRK]

Don't you see? We can never
go back...[BRK]

Love me the way i am, and
embrace the way of goddess
althena.[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR05]
Mauri, i know that you're
this way because of me,
but i want to fix that![BRK]

I had no choice back then.
It was the only way you
could survive![BRK]

Every time i think about
that day, it drives a knife
through my heart![BRK]

But i can't join you here!
Don't you see that the
goddess is a fraud?[BRK]

She's imprisoned you in
some kind of eternal dark-
ness.[BRK]

I'm here to get you out. To
find the real mauri once
again![BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR15]
Oh, ronfar, let's not talk
about that right now...[BRK]

Let's talk about the times
we used to have, the games
that we played together,[BRK]

and let's forget about this
crazy mess that both of us
are in.[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR05]
Mauri, i wish i could. But
more is at stake here than
us...[BRK]

You've got to give me some
straight answers before I
can help you.[BRK]

Tell me, what's going on
in this terrible city?[BRK]

Why is it you never show the
sweet smile of innocence I
fell in love with?[BRK]

All i see now when you smile
is the fire of hate in your
eyes.[BRK]

Mauri, you have to tell me
before i can help you![BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR15]
...enough of this nonsense,
ronfar![BRK]

Nothing has changed except
you. I'm the same person
you fell in love with.[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR05]
But mauri...you...have
...changed![BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR15]
If you cannot accept me for
who i am and join me in
althena's glorious service,[BRK]

then i'm afraid i will have
to end your pathetic life
along with the others.[BRK]

At least once i've taken
your life, you will be mine
forever...[BRK]

And that is what i've....[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

.......
.........[BRK]

[POR00]
Ron...far....this...is...
not me...[BRK]

Help! I...am awash in a sea
....of.....darkness....[BRK]

I-i...am...right here...
....please, hurry...[BRK]

Release me...before i.....
i....disappear forever....[BRK]

I...[BRK]

.....love[BRK]

............you![BRK]

[ROR05]
...m...mauri, what in the
world is going on!?[BRK]

Are you in there, mauri?
Wait! Come back!!!!!
[END]

=== e | 1bac0 | a0 ===
[POR15]
Ha ha ha ha ha![BRK]

That's one way to shut
you up![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Hrmph! I can't believe
those memories still
exist.[BRK]

I will soon wash them from
this wretched mind...[END]

=== f | 1bb70 | 160 ===
[POR05]
...and when i woke up, i was
in this comfy little cell
countin' hash marks.[BRK]

I can't believe that i could
have been such a fool.[BRK]

Mauri is obviously under
some kind of black spell
from the goddess...[BRK]

...and has been ever since
the day i cured her of the
disease.[BRK]

The fake goddess will pay
for what she's done to
mauri...[BRK]

Believe me...she will
pay!!!

[END]

=== 10 | 1bce8 | ad ===
[POR13]
I've accomplished all that
i can.[BRK]

From here on, you're on
your own.[BRK]

When you speak of this day
remember that you were saved
by the deeds of...[BRK]

...................mystere![END]

=== 11 | 1bd9e | 194 ===
[POR02]
Okay, leo...uh, i mean
mystere![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...i wonder why leo couldn't
just help us without going
through this charade...[BRK]

[POR05]
I think it has something to
do with the fact that leo
is in althena's service.[BRK]

I'm guessing he has his
doubts about her, but not
enough to help us outright.[BRK]

Without a disguise like that
he would lose not only his
position, but his life.[BRK]

At least he found a way to
help us...
