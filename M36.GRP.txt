[POR05]
I don't believe you guys
found me in this crazy
place![BRK]

I have no idea where Jean
ended up.[BRK]

Look, there's no way I can
pass that test.[BRK]

I'm a preacher, not a
prestidigitator.[BRK]

[POR07]
I'm sorry, Ronfar![BRK]

[POR05]
Why are you sorry, Lemina?
It's not your fault.[BRK]

[POR07]
I mean, they're supposed
to be magicians...[BRK]

They give us all a bad
name!

[END]

[POR05]
I did hear that there's an
exit at the bottom of this
labyrinth.[BRK]

It's some sorta secret
entrance to the Magic Guild.[BRK]

They say that lord fatty
uses it, so let's keep our
eyes peeled.[END]

=== 4 | 16a36 | 126 ===
[POR10]
I was beginning to wonder if
you guys were ever going to
find me.[BRK]

As I expected, I'm not
gifted with magical powers![BRK]

I'm more of a hands-on
person...[BRK]

But to be dropped into the
pit like that...ow![BRK]

[POR07]
Jean, I...
I'm sorry...[BRK]

[POR10]
Lemina, you didn't know.
Don't feel guilty. I'm not
mad at you.
[END]

=== 5 | 16b6c | 8b ===
[POR10]
Did you hear that Borgan
sometimes comes to this
labyrinth?[BRK]

They say there's a secret
back door to the Guild at
the bottom of this cave.[END]

=== 6 | 16c0e | fc ===
I hope that you guys have
strong backs. If you don't,
you'll be in pain.[BRK]

Borgan works us until our 
hands are blistered, and 
our backs are broken...[BRK]

If I was you, I'd do 
something to get ya thrown
into prison.[BRK]

At least you don't have to
work there...[END]

=== 7 | 16d22 | 39 ===
I don't have any hope of 
ever getting out of this
place.[END]

=== 8 | 16d6e | 70 ===
I felt a terrible shaking
down here. Did Borgan fall
out of bed?[BRK]

It's a wonder that the 
ceiling didn't cave-in.[END]

=== 9 | 16df2 | e4 ===
Borgan is so sadistic. He 
comes down here just to
make fun of us.[BRK]

I think he finds some kind
of pleasure in tormenting
innocent people...[BRK]

I can't believe that people
who have magic powers would
treat us like this.[BRK]

[POR07]
....
.....[END]

=== a | 16eee | 5e ===
His lardness hasn't been 
down here for a long time.[BRK]

Do you think he has a girl?[BRK]

[POR07]
....
.....[END]

=== b | 16f60 | f0 ===
I kind of miss Borgan's
threats.[BRK]

It was kind of fun watching
him try to get his 
heftyness through here...[BRK]

You should've seen him when
he tried to go down these
narrow passages...[BRK]

Now that was almost worth
an eternity of pain and
suffering![END]

=== c | 17060 | e3 ===
Can you believe that Borgan
forces us to work in this
rat-infested place?[BRK]

I've heard that Borgan is
making money off of the 
stuff we're mining!![BRK]

[POR07]
That mega-slug! I should be
getting some kind of kick-
back for saving people![END]

=== d | 17156 | 80 ===
What!? I don't have to work
in this hellhole anymore?[BRK]

Say, who do I see about
collecting a paycheck for
all the work I've done?
[END]

=== e | 171ea | db ===
Why doesn't his fatness use
those great magic powers to
do this work for us?[BRK]

If he had supreme power, he
could do all this work, and
he wouldn't even need us.[BRK]

I think Borgan is trying to
hide something from all of
us...[END]

=== f | 172dc | 47 ===
I think only savages find
some perverse pleasure in
people suffering...[END]

=== 10 | 1733a | 8b ===
Hey! Last time I talked to
you, I got beaten by the
guards.[BRK]

But I guess it was worth it
if you had something to do
with Borgan's downfall!
[END]

=== 11 | 173e0 | 33 ===
I don't believe it! You
actually kept your promise.[END]

=== 12 | 17426 | d9 ===
I hope my husband is having
a really nice time up there
in Neo-Vane.[BRK]

He has magic power and was
told by Borgan that he could
live there.[BRK]

If I find him having an 
affair, I'm going to drive 
this pick right into his...[END]

=== 13 | 17516 | 33 ===
I really miss my husband.[BRK]

I hope he misses me, too.[END]

=== 14 | 17560 | b1 ===
Did you see my husband in
Neo-Vane? Tell me if you 
saw him with another woman. [BRK]

I've been talking to 
loraina...[BRK]

And she's told me how to 
take care of a man that 
hurts you...[END]

=== 15 | 1762c | 43 ===
I can finally go and find my
husband. I hope he's waiting
for me...[END]

=== 16 | 17682 | a6 ===
I almost got out of this
stupid place...[BRK]

I would've made it if it
wasn't for that stupid door
on the bottom level...[BRK]

They say only people that
have magic can open it.[END]

=== 17 | 17740 | 46 ===
I'd give half of my brain
just to have enough magic
to open that door.[END]

=== 18 | 1779a | 75 ===
I've heard that Neo-Vane was
destroyed.[BRK]

Oh, I'm so sad...[BRK]

...ha! Like hell I am.[BRK]

This is the happiest day
of my life![END]

=== 19 | 17822 | a3 ===
Please, you must help me
find my mommy and daddy.[BRK]

The bad people here force
me to work in this pit![BRK]

I've never been this lonely
before in my life. Please,
help me![END]

=== 1a | 178dc | a9 ===
They say that magic is 
supposed to bind our world
together...[BRK]

How can they say that when
it separates us from our
families?[BRK]

[POR07]
This isn't what magic is 
supposed to be.[END]

=== 1b | 17998 | 85 ===
Thank you! I can't believe
that I can finally go home
to my parents.[BRK]

This is real magic! I owe
you so much! How can I
ever repay you?[END]

=== 1c | 17a30 | 72 ===
Come on, grab a spoon and
help me dig my way out of
this place.[BRK]

If you do most of the work,
I'll let you go first.[END]

=== 1d | 17aba | c6 ===
Don't worry, I'm taking a
ceramics class so that we 
can make molds of our heads.[BRK]

That way, when we escape,
we'll leave the fake heads
here,[BRK]

and the guards will see them
and think we're still here.
[END]

=== 1e | 17b94 | 70 ===
I almost finished digging my
tunnel when Neo-Vane 
crashed.[BRK]

But hey! You won't see me
complaining about that...

The spell on this door will
be easy to break...[BRK]

Hiro, let's go and free Jean
and Ronfar from the mine,
and then we'll all get out![END]

=== 23 | 1b9ee | 70 ===
[POR07]
Like I said, I can break 
this spell...[BRK]

But let's go and get Ronfar
and Jean so we can all 
leave this place![END]

=== 24 | 1ba7a | 5b ===
[POR07]
Hello, are you mega-deaf?[BRK]

I'm not going to open this
door until we free Ronfar
and Jean![END]

=== 25 | 1baf0 | 34 ===
[POR07]
Okay, time to break the 
spell on this barrier...[END]

=== 26 | 1bb2e | 1a ===
[POR07]
Ha! There![BRK]

...let's go![END]

=== 27 | 1bb60 | 88 ===
The transport pad over
there leads to Borgan's
Magic Guild.[BRK]

But if you can't use magic,
you might as well forget
about trying to get in.[END]

=== 28 | 1bc00 | 80 ===
The magic wall is impossible
to get past.[BRK]

I'm a demolitions expert,
and I've tried everything![BRK]

That wall just won't fall
down...[END]

=== 29 | 1bc98 | f3 ===
What are you? Treasure- 
hunters or something? There 
is no treasure in here...[BRK]

[POR07]
Duh! I'm not here to get
rich. I've got to save my
mother![BRK]

[POR02]
News flash, Lemina of Vane
announced today that she's
not interested in money...[BRK]

Film at eleven...[END]

=== 2a | 1bda6 | 41 ===
Get lost! I'm going to get
into trouble if I talk to
you anymore.[END]

=== 2b | 1bdfa | 4e ===
If you're not careful, the 
guards will find you and
beat the crap out of you.[END]
