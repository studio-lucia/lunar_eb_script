[POR02]
Let's see...i think they
said the manor was to the
east...[BRK]

I just want you all to
know that i'm against this!
[END]

=== 1 | 9c5c | b9 ===
Welcome to takkar! This is
a resting point for all the
tradesmen in the area.[BRK]

They come here to rest up
and trade stories of the
road...[BRK]

I should warn you about the
house to the east...[END]

=== 2 | 9d22 | 7e ===
The ghost manor is rumored
to be haunted by a terrible
force![BRK]

[POR02]
Ghost?! H...hiro...let's
steer clear of that place,
o...okay?[END]

=== 3 | 9db8 | 9a ===
The tradesman passing
through here are saying that
the ghost manor is silent.[BRK]

Do you think the ghosts have
left? I hope so. It would be
good for business.[END]

=== 4 | 9e62 | 44 ===
Most of the people that come
through takkar are looking
to get rich.[END]

=== 5 | 9ec0 | 82 ===
Hey there, travelers! I'm
afraid i can't let you pass
this gate.[BRK]

There's been reports of
monsters in the cave, so
we've sealed it.[END]

=== 6 | 9f46 | e4 ===
As a priest of althena,
i cannot let you pass in
good conscience.[BRK]

It's sealed until the
monster situation is
resolved.[BRK]

[POR05]
C'mon! This is the only road
that leads to nota, and,
ultimately, pentagulia![BRK]

Ya gotta let us pass, buddy![END]

=== 7 | a042 | 1ac ===
I'm sorry, i can't open this
gate until the monster
situation is resolved.[BRK]

If i did, the lives of all
the villagers would be in
danger.[BRK]

[POR05]
But we can defeat the beasts
if you just let us through![BRK]

[POR00]
I'm sorry, i don't have the
authority to make that
decision.[BRK]

Besides, i have already sent
for lord leo. He'll take
care of this in no time.[BRK]

Just be patient. He should
be here soon...[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, if leo's coming, we'd
better lay low...[END]

=== 8 | a1f8 | 71 ===
[POR20]
Hm hm hm...you're wasting
your time with that fool.[BRK]

Come with me and i'll
share something very
interesting...
[END]

=== 9 | a272 | 10b ===
[POR20]
If you have enough magic
power, you can bypass this
gate.[BRK]

There's a haunted manor to
the east of the village with
a secret mountain pass.[BRK]

If you can get through the
manor, the pass will take
you to nota.[BRK]

I'll be waiting outside the
manor...don't keep me
waiting...[END]

=== a | a386 | 174 ===
[POR02]
Uh...didn't she say the
manor was haunted? Maybe she
was one of the spooks![BRK]

[POR08]
I sensed that she had
an aura of strong magic
about her...[BRK]

[POR10]
Maybe we should take her
advice and check it out...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, this is just great! Some
weird girl comes out of 
nowhere,[BRK]

and we're gonna take her
advice and follow her
through some spook house![BRK]

This is just going to make
my week!

[END]

=== b | a512 | 94 ===
This gate is to remain
sealed until the monsters
threatening us are defeated.[BRK]

Don't worry, lord leo will
be here soon to take care of
the situation.[END]

=== c | a5ba | 75 ===
It was strange. All of the
monsters disappeared very
suddenly.[BRK]

Maybe they heard that lord
leo was coming...ha ha ha!
[END]

=== d | a63e | 8f ===
Now that the danger has
passed, this gate is open
for all to use.[BRK]

[POR02]
You turned awfully helpful
all of the sudden. Are you
the same gatekeeper?[END]

=== e | a6dc | 10a ===
Fearsome monsters have been
coming into the village
lately.[BRK]

That's why we sealed the
north gate.[BRK]

If we don't open the gate,
they can't get in anymore.[BRK]

The only problem is that
the north gate leads the
way to nota.[BRK]

And until the monsters are
defeated, we're cut off.
[END]

=== f | a7fe | d3 ===
I wish i knew the source of
those strange monsters![BRK]

I think it's that strange
hooded figure that arrived
about the same time.[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, hiro, that's the hooded
figure we talked to![BRK]

I don't like the smell of
this...[END]

=== 10 | a8e8 | 13c ===
I wish i knew the source of
those strange monsters![BRK]

Now there's a girl named
lemina scamming strangers.[BRK]

She tells them she knows a
way around the town and
charges them for the info![BRK]

[POR02]
What!?[BRK]

[POR07]
Hey! It was not a scam![BRK]

It was a test for applicants
to the magic guild![BRK]

...and the money was used to 
restore the guild![END]

=== 11 | aa34 | 64 ===
I heard that the monsters
were made by the magic
guild.[BRK]

I wonder who started that
ridiculous rumor?![END]

=== 12 | aaa6 | 41 ===
[POR02]
I think it was lemina.[BRK]

[POR07]
It was not, you little
flying stain![END]

=== 13 | aaf6 | 6f ===
There's a hooded figure
lurking around town.[BRK]

You'd better not talk to it.
If you do accidentally, come
to me...[END]

=== 14 | ab7c | 2c ===
Remember, don't talk to the
hooded figure...[END]

=== 15 | abb2 | 28 ===
There it is! Whatever you
do, stay away![END]

=== 16 | abe4 | 8e ===
You talked to the hooded
figure, didn't you?[BRK]

You're doomed now! She's
going to stalk you forever![BRK]

Your only hope is to run,
run, run far away![END]

=== 17 | ac8e | b0 ===
Now that you've talked to
the hooded figure, your
only hope is to run away![BRK]

Run, run, run! If she finds
you again, she'll...she'll
...i don't know what![BRK]

But it'll be terrible!
[END]

=== 18 | ad56 | a7 ===
You're lucky the hooded
girl disappeared![BRK]

I heard she is a member of
the old vane magic guild.[BRK]

One thing's for sure: she's
really annoying. If you see
her, be careful.[END]

=== 19 | ae14 | 13c ===
Hey! Aren't you the girl
that was going about town
in a cloak?[BRK]

Are you really the premier
of the vane magic guild?[BRK]

[POR07]
I'm surprised you even have
to ask![BRK]

Can't you tell from my
classic good looks and
superior intellect?[BRK]

Of course i'm the premier of
the guild, idiot![BRK]

...well, actually the junior
premier...but still![END]

=== 1a | af68 | 78 ===
I'm surprised you're all
still okay. That magic
guild master is weird.[BRK]

I thought she might do
something terrible to you![END]

=== 1b | aff8 | bc ===
What!? You're still hanging
around that weird premier of
the magic guild?[BRK]

You'd better keep a close
eye on her![BRK]

[POR07]
Why should they do that?
You're the weirdo. We should
keep an eye on you![END]

=== 1c | b0c8 | bd ===
I can't believe that girl is
the premier of the vane
magic guild.[BRK]

I mean, i knew they were
hard up, but now they're
employing kids?[BRK]

Oh well, i guess you can't
judge a person by their
looks.[END]

=== 1d | b198 | fb ===
Are you sure you're the
premier of the magic guild?
...the vane magic guild?[BRK]

[POR07]
Of course i am. How many
times do i have to tell you?[BRK]

You should be able to see it
just by observing my mastery
of complicated magic,...[BRK]

And my impeccable social
graces...[END]

=== 1e | b2a2 | 90 ===
P-please...have mercy on me,
for i...i have no magic
ability![BRK]

[POR02]
What the heck's wrong with
this bozo? It seems like
he's afraid of something...[END]

=== 1f | b34a | 68 ===
No...no....no! Get away from
me! I told you to leave
...me...alone![BRK]

Ahhhh! Leave me alone...
please!



[END]

=== 20 | b3bc | 51 ===
[POR02]
What's wrong with that guy?
He's acting like he's seen
a ghost or something...[END]

=== 21 | b428 | 44 ===
Please! Stop following me!
I...i can't take it
anymore![BRK]

Heeelllppp!
[END]

=== 22 | b484 | 60 ===
I was a fool for fearing
that stupid hooded girl in
the first place.[BRK]

I dunno what got into me...[END]

=== 23 | b4fc | 10b ===
Oh...oh no! You're the
hooded girl, aren't you![BRK]

Please! Ya gotta leave me
alone! I don't know why you
keep stalking me![BRK]

[POR08]
Why is this man so very
afraid of lemina? I don't
understand...[BRK]

[POR07]
Me neither. A lot of people
in this town are afraid of
me for some reason...
[END]

=== 24 | b61a | 80 ===
Ohhhh...oh...the trial
at the manor...it was
terrible.[BRK]

I still have nightmares
about it...the place is
haunted now, you know.


[END]

=== 25 | b6a8 | 66 ===
[POR07]
You are such a lightweight.
I'm glad you failed my
little test at the manor...[BRK]

Talk about a baby...[END]

=== 26 | b71c | 3f ===
[POR05]
Well, some people got it,
and some people don't![BRK]

He don't...[END]

=== 27 | b76e | 95 ===
I've been having nightmares
from that stupid trial at
the manor forever![BRK]

Now that the world is at
peace, maybe i'll finally
get a good night's sleep.[END]

=== 28 | b81a | dd ===
Why, why, why?! Stop buggin'
me, lady![BRK]

I almost had forgotten about
that cockamamie trial at the
manor, and you show up![BRK]

[POR07]
Well, i can give you one
more chance to pass a magic
trial...[BRK]

[POR00]
No, no, no! Just leave me
alone![END]

=== 29 | b912 | 48 ===
I finally got a good night's
sleep.[BRK]

I hope the nightmares are
over...


[END]

=== 2a | b96a | 91 ===
My son is such a stupid boy!
He falls for a strange magic
girl, and now look at him![BRK]

He went into the haunted
manor to try to impress her.
Idiot![END]

=== 2b | ba12 | b1 ===
The girl who made him take
a trial at the manor is
crazy![BRK]

I heard she's charging
admission to take the test!
Can you believe that?![BRK]

And my son was dumb enough
to fall for it...
[END]

=== 2c | bada | 85 ===
If my son was dumb enough
to get caught in that girl's
trap,[BRK]

you might be in danger, too.
Be careful of that girl, i'm
warning you...[END]

=== 2d | bb72 | 67 ===
That girl is obsessed by
money![BRK]

I don't think she has any
connection to the magic
guild of vane at all![END]

=== 2e | bbe6 | a0 ===
[POR07]
That's what you get for
thinking![BRK]

Of course i'm associated
with the guild...i'm the
junior premier![BRK]

[POR02]
But premier of what? That
place is really run-down...
[END]

=== 2f | bc96 | 8f ===
Now that there's peace in
the land, my son seems to
be getting better.[BRK]

I'm so thankful! I don't
know how much more of his
whining i could take![END]

=== 30 | bd34 | a8 ===
You'd better be careful. I
just heard there's strange
monsters roaming about.[BRK]

And a hooded figure has
been seen around town...[BRK]

Beware the moors...that's
what i say...

[END]

=== 31 | bdf0 | 64 ===
I don't believe that the
girl in the cloak is the
premier of vane.[BRK]

She's too flighty...too
weird...
[END]

=== 32 | be68 | 92 ===
I wish i knew how to help
you out, but i don't.[BRK]

So you might as well just
stop bothering me.[BRK]

It's really quite annoying.[BRK]

I mean it![BRK]

Are you deaf?
[END]

=== 33 | bf0e | 78 ===
I heard about the happenings
at the ghost manor.[BRK]

So, the monster was a fake,
huh? That seems almost too
good to be true.[END]

=== 34 | bf96 | b7 ===
My my my! How you kids have
grown since the last time
you were here.[BRK]

Seems like that was just
yesterday...[BRK]

[POR02]
That's probably because
you're getting senile as you
approach middle age.[END]

=== 35 | c060 | b9 ===
Say there, strangers! Have
you decided on a place to
stay while you're here?[BRK]

Tell you what! I'll make you
a great deal on a room! It's
only 10s![BRK]

And best of all, breakfast
is included!
[END]

=== 36 | c130 | 4b ===
All the best-looking women
stay at my hotel. Why don't
you stay there, too?[END]

=== 37 | c188 | c0 ===
[POR05]
Hey chief, this sounds like
a pretty sweet deal![BRK]

10S per night, free
breakfast, and curvy scenery
that's easy on the eyes![BRK]

[POR02]
Whoa there, ronfar! Rein in
the stallion! We've got
work to do![END]

=== 38 | c25c | 70 ===
Say, have you decided to
stay at the bounteous babe
hotel?[BRK]

[POR02]
No, we've got work to do.
Maybe some other time...[END]

=== 39 | c2e4 | 99 ===
Now that the monsters have
disappeared, the trade route
from nota is open.[BRK]

Our hotel is almost filled
to capacity. You'd better
hurry if you want a room![END]

=== 3a | c38a | 9c ===
[POR05]
Oh, man! C'mon, hiro! Can't
we just stay one night? I
mean, sheesh...the babes...[BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, you know we can't
stop here now, so why do
you keep asking?![END]

=== 3b | c442 | 98 ===
If you try to do battle when
your bodies are deprived of
sleep, it's dangerous.[BRK]

Why not spend the night at
the bounteous babe? We've
got free breakfast![END]

=== 3c | c4ea | 85 ===
Now that the world is at
peace once again, business
is up 500% over last year.[BRK]

I'm thinking of expanding
the hotel! Isn't that great?[END]

=== 3d | c580 | bf ===
[POR05]
So does that mean there will
be more bounteous babes to
check out...hoouuahhh![BRK]

[POR09]
Ronfar, you better cool it,
or i'll tell mauri![BRK]

If she finds out how you've
been acting, you're dead
meat![END]

=== 3e | c64e | 8a ===
I failed the trial at the
ghost manor because i was
not good with magic.[BRK]

Those flying girls are 
impossible! I couldn't even
scratch them![END]

=== 3f | c6ec | 62 ===
Oh no! There she is...it's
that girl...that terrible
girl![BRK]

Oh no...i think she's after
you now...
[END]

=== 40 | c762 | b6 ===
I feel sorry for you if the
hooded girl is after you.[BRK]

She won't stop stalking you
until you take her test at
the ghost manor![BRK]

It's horrible in there! Just
a big nightmare....ouuuggh![END]

=== 41 | c82c | 83 ===
I've heard many rumors about
the ghost manor lately.[BRK]

Some say that it wasn't real
at all, but just put there
to test magic ability.[END]

=== 42 | c8be | 9e ===
The hooded girl from the
ghost manor is rumored to be
premier of the magic guild.[BRK]

But if she was the premier,
she wouldn't do something
like that, would she?
[END]

=== 43 | c96a | 20 ===
[POR07]
I'm sure she had her
reasons.[END]

=== 44 | c99e | be ===
You know what? Huh? Huh?
Huh?[BRK]

I met the premier of the
magic guild of vane![BRK]

When i grow up, i want to be
in the magic guild.[BRK]

But it costs a lot, so i'm
gonna start saving my money
right now![END]

=== 45 | ca74 | 32 ===
When i get bigger, i'm gonna
join the magic guild![END]

=== 46 | caba | 78 ===
I used to want to be a
world-class trader, but
i've changed my mind.[BRK]

Now, i just want to be a
member of the magic guild![END]

=== 47 | cb40 | 72 ===
[POR07]
Well, remember, you have to
have a lot of money to enter
into the magic guild.[BRK]

So you better start saving
now!
[END]

=== 48 | cbc6 | 7a ===
I need money to become a
member of the magic guild,
so i'm saving my earnings.[BRK]

Hopefully, i'll have enough
when i grow up.[END]

=== 49 | cc4e | a4 ===
[POR07]
Well, i'll tell you what.
I'll give you this savings
book.[BRK]

That way, you can deposit
your savings with me![BRK]

I'll keep them in a special
account until you get big![END]

=== 4a | cd02 | 6a ===
I've saved lots of money
to get into the guild
when i get big.[BRK]

But i still don't have
enough to join yet.
[END]

=== 4b | cd7a | 44 ===
[POR07]
Well, why don't you give it
to me, so i can keep it safe
for you?[END]

=== 4c | cdce | 86 ===
A strange girl who called
herself the premier of the
magic guild was just here.[BRK]

I don't know what she could
possibly want around here.[END]

=== 4d | ce6c | bf ===
That girl who calls herself
the premier of the magic
guild is strange.[BRK]

I think she likes money way
too much.[BRK]

What's the relationship
between magic and money?
Is there one?[BRK]

I don't think so...[END]

=== 4e | cf46 | 50 ===
I don't understand why that
magic guild girl makes such
a big deal out of money.[END]

=== 4f | cfaa | 50 ===
I haven't seen the premier
of the money grubbers guild.
I wonder where she went?[END]

=== 50 | d008 | 6b ===
[POR07]
That's the magic guild, not
the money grubbers guild![BRK]

[POR02]
...hehe...i think he has
you pegged, lemina.


[END]

=== 51 | d082 | 70 ===
Hrmph! I guess the money
grubbers premier saved the
world, didn't she?[BRK]

Maybe my opinion of her was
misguided...
[END]

=== 52 | d100 | 2a ===
[POR07]
That's magic guild, not
money grubbers![END]

=== 53 | d13a | 5a ===
Hmmm...new travelers...[BRK]

...you poor, poor, souls.[BRK]

[POR02]
Poor souls? What is he
talking about?[END]

=== 54 | d1ac | 9a ===
You aren't friends of the
cloaked figure, are you?[BRK]

It's been looking this way
ever since you came.[BRK]

I don't envy you...[BRK]

[POR02]
Why? What are you talking
about?[END]

=== 55 | d262 | a9 ===
That cloaked girl seems to
be very fond of you.[BRK]

That can be quite dangerous.
I wouldn't want to be in
your shoes...[BRK]

[POR02]
Will you please tell me what
you're talking about?[END]

=== 56 | d322 | f2 ===
Not too long ago, i believed
what the girl said and took
her test.[BRK]

It was a nerve-shattering
experience that i don't
care to relive.[BRK]

I still have nightmares
about it to this day.[BRK]

To add insult to injury, 
she took money from me as
a test fee![END]

=== 57 | d430 | e6 ===
Aren't you the...[BRK]

[POR07]
Yep! I'm lemina, premier of
the magic guild.[BRK]

Sorry you didn't have what
it takes to be a member of
the magic guild.[BRK]

Maybe you can try again
someday![BRK]

[POR00]
Are you kidding? Never!
I've had my fill of magic
tests!
[END]

=== 58 | d536 | 70 ===
After that terrible
experience with the magic
trial, [BRK]

i have no desire to be
anything other than a 
tradesman...[END]

=== 59 | d5b6 | 27 ===
Yep, the simple life's the
best life...[END]

=== 5a | d5e2 | e ===
Takkar village[END]

=== 5b | ed26 | e ===
Donated 100s.
[END]

=== 5c | ed62 | 125 ===
There has been much
commotion in the village
lately.[BRK]

Villagers are afraid of all
the monsters that have come
to our village.[BRK]

But we of the althena cult
will destroy the monsters
using althena's power.[BRK]

If donations increase, lord
leo will come and slay the
monsters![BRK]

Now then, will you donate?
[END]

=== 5d | ee9e | 7c ===
The world is safest under
the watch of althena's
cult members.[BRK]

The sooner you realize this,
the better it will be for
you...[END]

=== 5e | ef2e | 7e ===
What? The monsters have all
disappeared from the area?[BRK]

Hmm...well then, the power
of althena's cult is greater
than i thought![END]

=== 5f | efba | 4f ===
[POR02]
It wasn't you...it was...[BRK]

[POR07]
Shh! Ruby! Be quiet! They
don't need to know!

[END]

=== 60 | f018 | 9e ===
Now that you have shown the
error of our ways, we are
humbled before the village.[BRK]

The people look upon us very
suspiciously. I hope we can
regain their trust.[END]

=== 61 | f0c6 | 78 ===
Welcome to takkar. Make a
donation and pray for safe
travel, won't you?[BRK]

If you do not, grave things
could happen to you.[END]

=== 62 | f152 | 6d ===
You should donate to the
goddess althena before you
travel.[BRK]

That way, she can watch over
you on your journey.[END]

=== 63 | f1cc | 106 ===
[POR07]
I think this money would be
put to better use at the
magic guild.[BRK]

People should start donating
to the magic guild instead.[BRK]

Then the guild can make
this world safe again for
everyone.[BRK]

[POR00]
Blasphemy! You dare to speak
against the leadership of
althena herself?!
[END]

=== 64 | f2e2 | 99 ===
We were following the wrong
path. Goddess althena would
not be so money-hungry.[BRK]

It was our own selfish
desire that led us to ask
for so many donations...[END]

=== 65 | f38a | 87 ===
Isn't this shrine the most
beautiful place you've ever
seen?[BRK]

If you want a long life and
much happiness, donate to
the goddess althena.[END]

=== 66 | f424 | 46 ===
For a life free from worry
about money, donate to the
goddess althena.[END]

=== 67 | f478 | 52 ===
[POR07]
I was thinking that an ira
would be a more prudent
investment.[BRK]

Don't you think?[END]

=== 68 | f4da | 65 ===
Don't you want to keep this
shrine this beautiful?[BRK]

Well then, you'd better
donate to goddess althena![END]

=== 69 | f552 | 80 ===
In my former life, i was a
tradesman, but then i felt
the calling.[BRK]

Now i am a servant to the
cult of althena. Donation,
please?
[END]

=== 6a | f5ea | 7c ===
When i quit my former life,
i gave all my assets to the
althena cult.[BRK]

I live now only to collect
more donations for althena.[END]

=== 6b | f674 | 4d ===
[POR07]
You what? You gave all your
property to these kooks? I
can't believe it...[END]

=== 6c | f6d0 | 5c ===
The donation you give is not
as important as the prayer
you pray.[BRK]

But the minimum is 1000s.
[END]

=== 6d | f73c | 80 ===
We are trying our best to
spread the word of althena,[BRK]

but there are many that
still want to sing, dance,
and make money instead.[END]

=== 6e | f7ca | 36 ===

singing and dancing...

[POR07]
That's right! And i bet she
loved money, too![BRK]

[POR02]
Um, lemina...i think you're
too far out on that limb...[END]

=== 70 | f888 | 7d ===
Now i understand the true
teachings of althena.[BRK]

She wants all of us to enjoy
life by singing and dancing
to lift our spirits.[END]

=== 71 | f914 | 8d ===
Many of the villagers don't
believe what we tell them
of goddess althena.[BRK]

Someday, the goddess will
come and punish them for
their ignorance![END]

=== 72 | f9b4 | 89 ===
We of the althena cult try
to steer the people in the
right way.[BRK]

Those that will not donate
to the cause will be
punished by the goddess.[END]

=== 73 | fa4c | 7f ===
Now i know that althena,
goddess of beauty and love,
wouldn't punish us.[BRK]

Who started that doctrine?
It seems like nonsense now![END]

Welcome, travelers![BRK]

I am a messenger from the
magic guild of vane. We are
recruiting new members.[BRK]

Would you like to join the
guild? There's only a simple
test, and an entrance fee.[BRK]

[POR02]
Hey, hiro, that sounds like
fun. Why don't we take the
test?[BRK]

[POR20]
Oh, pooh! I forgot to tell
you we don't allow flying
cats.[BRK]

I always forget that...[BRK]

[POR02]
Well then, that's still okay
since i'm not a cat.[BRK]

[POR20]
...but...you look like a cat
with...[BRK]

[POR05]
Hey sister, hate to break up
the raging kitty debate, but
we've got to get moving.[BRK]

We don't have time to take
your test...[BRK]

[POR20]
Ah, yes, but you cannot pass
the gate to continue your
quest, anyway.[BRK]

Haven't you heard? The gate
is sealed because of
terrible monster attacks![BRK]

[POR10]
Then we'll tell the guard
we can kill the monsters if
he opens the gate.[BRK]

[POR20]
....
.....[BRK]

Perhaps that plan will work,
or maybe it won't. You can
only try...[BRK]

...in any event, i'll be
around...

[END]

=== 76 | 10ca8 | d7 ===
[POR02]
Whew! Talk about your hood
fetish kooks! That girl was
a mountain of weird![BRK]

I mean...offering us a test
to enter the magic guild,
and then excluding me?[BRK]

What kind of attitude is
that? Gimme a break![BRK]

[POR01]

It's my job to transport
goods from nota to dalton.[BRK]

I always like to stop in at
this bar for a little r&r
before i continue.[END]

=== 78 | 10e22 | fa ===
My usual route is from nota
to dalton, but i just heard
about a town called larpa.[BRK]

They say it's just past
dalton...[BRK]

I was thinkin' about goin'
down there to see if i can
expand my service route.[BRK]

Any of you guys heard about
what it's like down there?[END]

=== 79 | 10f2a | c8 ===
[POR05]
Let me get my dice and i'll
show ya, chief![BRK]

[POR02]
Whoa! Put those things away,
ronfar![BRK]

Mister, you don't want to
learn about larpa from
ronfar.[BRK]

It'll be the most expensive
travelogue you've ever seen![END]

=== 7a | 11002 | d6 ===
Now that the world is at
peace, i was thinkin' about
settling down here.[BRK]

I mean, the location's nice,
and whoa! Did you see the
bounteous babe hotel?[BRK]

We're talking some righteous
bounty![BRK]

Yeah...i could live here...[END]

=== 7b | 110e8 | 96 ===
Now that the gates have been
closed, our business is
going to die out.[BRK]

I sure hope they get those
monsters killed in a hurry,
or we're in big trouble![END]

=== 7c | 11192 | 5b ===
At least the wine supply
from nota is back on
schedule again![BRK]

That blockade was killing
us![END]

=== 7d | 111fc | 9b ===
Now that the world is safe
again, sales of flowers and
champagne are up.[BRK]

Fortunately, i saw it coming

Cheers to hiro![END]

The althena cult is making
a business out of the fear
of these monsters.[BRK]

I don't know how the goddess
can allow them to do that![END]

=== 82 | 114f2 | 38 ===
[POR10]
I'm sure she won't allow it
for long...[BRK]

[POR08]

The cult leaders are getting
to be real sticklers![BRK]

Now they say that alcohol,
song, and dance are off-
limits to followers![BRK]

Kevin bacon, where are you
when we need you?[END]

=== 84 | 115fe | a8 ===
Now that the althena cult
members got the monsters
under control,[BRK]

they're saying that it's a
sign that the goddess
approves of their teachings![BRK]

I can't believe it's so.[END]

=== 85 | 116b6 | 85 ===
The followers of goddess
althena have changed
dramatically.[BRK]

Now, they enjoy song and
dance. In fact, they're
starting some festivals![END]

=== 86 | 11748 | 6b ===
[POR10]
That sounds more like the
althena i heard about as
a child.[BRK]

The one that inspired me
to become a dancer.[END]

=== 87 | 117c6 | 5a ===
Say there, strangers!
Haven't seen you in here
before.[BRK]

Where ya from? Nota?
Dalton? Larpa?[END]

My name is lucia. I have

Well then, you've come
mighty far. Perhaps you'd
like some dutch apple pie?[END]

Hehe...the girl's just
having some fun with you!
Actually, we're from larpa.[BRK]

We're on a tour of the area!
We'll be seein' ya...




[END]

=== 8a | 1195c | e3 ===
Ya know, your talk about the
blue star reminded me of a
legend i heard 'bout it.[BRK]

They say that long ago, our
ancestors came from the blue
star, courtesy of althena.[BRK]

Don't know if it's true, but
it's a mighty romantic
notion....[END]

=== 8b | 11a4c | c5 ===

What you speak is not
legend, but history. It
really happened long ago...[BRK]

Now how in the world would
you know that?[BRK]

Oh, i get it...you're pullin'
my leg again! Ha ha ha! Good
one...ya got me![END]

Say there, folks...sit down

I'll buy the first round of

Thanks for the heapin'
helpin' of your hospitality,
but we have to get moving.[BRK]

[POR00]
Okay then, but y'all come
back now, y'hear?[END]

=== 8d | 11c46 | f4 ===
I heard there is a way to
get back to the blue star.
It's in some tower...[BRK]

Ahhh...what a romantic
notion! Traveling to the
blue star...ouoummmmm...[BRK]

If only that dream could
come true![BRK]

I'm sure it will come true

Say, you look like you're
new to this town. At least
you picked a good inn![BRK]

I'm a traveling merchant.
Do you want to see any of
my wares?[END]

=== 98 | 1380c | a7 ===
[POR08]
Merchant? Wares? I don't
understand the meaning of
those words...[BRK]

If you remain ignorant of
those terms and credit-
cardless,[BRK]

you'll be every man's
fantasy mate![END]

Someday, i'm going to be the
most successful merchant in
all history![END]

With a little more work, i'm
going to set up my own shop
in takkar.[BRK]

That's step two in my dream
to be the most successful
merchant in history.[END]

[POR07]
Sorry, buster. I think that
title goes to me...[BRK]

...if selling guild
memberships counts...[END]

This inn is cheap and quite
clean.[BRK]

If i'm going to make my
dream come true, i have to
save where i can![END]

=== 9d | 13a9e | 73 ===
[POR07]
I'm pretty sure ramus and
ramus jr. Of meribia are
the most successful...[BRK]

It's going to be tough to
beat them...[END]

=== 9e | 13b20 | fd ===
Many people come here
because they like the
town's atmosphere.[BRK]

Once, long ago, i came to
this town and liked it so
much i set up this inn![BRK]

Best decision i ever made.[BRK]

I mean, it's just a tiny bed

my dream,[BRK]

We call that 'twins.'[END]

This inn is very popular
with the traveling merchants
in the area.[BRK]

They all like to stay here
when they have business in
takkar.[BRK]

I think they like the view.[END]

=== a5 | 14624 | df ===
My sister and i started this
inn when we noticed all the
travelers in town.[BRK]

Since most of them were
merchants,[BRK]

we knew a name like
'bounteous babe' would get
their attention.[BRK]

So, what do you say? Want to
give our inn a try?[END]

Well sugarplum, that's the
closest thing to a direct
invite i could hope for![BRK]

What do you say, chief?
Let's check it out...[END]

=== a7 | 147a4 | 4f ===
[POR07]
I think we'd better pass.
We're saving money, and this
inn is too expensive![END]

=== a8 | 1480a | 51 ===
This is the most popular inn
in the village. Sometimes,
even villagers stay here![END]

=== a9 | 1486a | 13a ===
Now that we've conquered the
market in this area, we're
thinking of expansion.[BRK]

If the franchise deal goes
through,[BRK]

there'll be a 'bounteous
babe inn' at every village
in the world![BRK]

Then, when we're stinking
rich, we can devote our time
to the women's movement.[BRK]

Don't you think men demean
women terribly these days?[END]

Whenever my business takes
me near this town, i always
stay here.[BRK]

This place is always stocked
with the most gorgeous
women! Talk about eye candy![BRK]

Whoooo whee![BRK]

Yeah, but in your case it's
more like phee-yeww![BRK]

Your looks are more like
eye sewage...[END]

Now that my business is
concluded in town, i've got

I sure wish i could take one

Two words:[BRK]

Personal[BRK]

Hygiene...[BRK]

Look it up, and maybe
someday you'll stand a
chance.

I decided to stay here a

You...think i have a chance
with the younger of the two
chicks that own this joint?[BRK]

She's pretty hot, huh?[BRK]

And...you're pretty cold.[BRK]

...and stinky. Here's a
dime, buy a clue.[END]

Even though i live in this

I'm hoping one of the women
will notice me and ask me
out.[END]

That woman over there is so
beautiful...like a delicate
rose.[BRK]

My heart belongs to her, and
she doesn't even know it.[END]

Now that the world is at
peace, the only tempest that

To love and have not is

Ever since the gate was

We have the lowest-priced
rooms in town, and since
no one can pass the gate,[BRK]

they just stay here and 
wait this monster situation
out.[END]

I'm so glad the monster
situation has eased up![BRK]

I mean, i liked the extra
business from stranded
travelers,[BRK]

but the threat of danger
hanging over our heads was
killing me![END]

You know, it's amazing. The
more people care about each
other, the more they fight.[BRK]

It seems to be some sort of
unwritten law.[BRK]

Take, for example, that
couple over there. They love
each other,[BRK]

but they've been bickering
ever since they got here.[BRK]

[POR02]
That's not always true! Nall
and i fight all the time, 
and we don't...[BRK]

...uh, never mind.

[END]

=== b4 | 15976 | 8d ===
That couple over there are
always bickering about
little things.[BRK]

But i think they really
love each other.[BRK]

He bought her roses the
other day.

Got that?[BRK]

Maybe i can calm her down
