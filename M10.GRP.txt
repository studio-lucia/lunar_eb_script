[POR02]
Let's see...I think they
said the manor was to the
east...[BRK]

I just want you all to
know that I'm against this![END]

=== 1 | 9c5c | b9 ===
Welcome to Takkar! This is
a resting point for all the
tradesmen in the area.[BRK]

They come here to rest up
and trade stories of the
road...[BRK]

I should warn you about the
house to the east...[END]

=== 2 | 9d22 | 7e ===
The Ghost Manor is rumored
to be haunted by a terrible
force![BRK]

[POR02]
Ghost?! H...Hiro...Let's
steer clear of that place,
o...okay?[END]

=== 3 | 9db8 | 9a ===
The tradesman passing
through here are saying that
the Ghost Manor is silent.[BRK]

Do you think the ghosts have
left? I hope so. It would be
good for business.[END]

=== 4 | 9e62 | 44 ===
Most of the people that come
through Takkar are looking
to get rich.[END]

=== 5 | 9ec0 | 82 ===
Hey there, travelers! I'm
afraid I can't let you pass
this gate.[BRK]

There's been reports of
monsters in the cave, so
we've sealed it.[END]

=== 6 | 9f46 | e4 ===
As a priest of Althena,
I cannot let you pass in
good conscience.[BRK]

It's sealed until the
monster situation is
resolved.[BRK]

[POR05]
C'mon! This is the only road
that leads to Nota, and,
ultimately, Pentagulia![BRK]

Ya gotta let us pass, buddy![END]

=== 7 | a042 | 1ac ===
I'm sorry, I can't open this
gate until the monster
situation is resolved.[BRK]

If I did, the lives of all
the villagers would be in
danger.[BRK]

[POR05]
But we can defeat the beasts
if you just let us through![BRK]

[POR00]
I'm sorry, I don't have the
authority to make that
decision.[BRK]

Besides, I have already sent
for Lord Leo. He'll take
care of this in no time.[BRK]

Just be patient. He should
be here soon...[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, if Leo's coming, we'd
better lay low...[END]

=== 8 | a1f8 | 71 ===
[POR20]
Hm hm hm...You're wasting
your time with that fool.[BRK]

Come with me and I'll
share something very
interesting...[END]

=== 9 | a272 | 10b ===
[POR20]
If you have enough magic
power, you can bypass this
gate.[BRK]

There's a haunted manor to
the east of the village with
a secret mountain pass.[BRK]

If you can get through the
manor, the pass will take
you to Nota.[BRK]

I'll be waiting outside the
manor...Don't keep me
waiting...[END]

=== a | a386 | 174 ===
[POR02]
Uh...Didn't she say the
manor was haunted? Maybe she
was one of the spooks![BRK]

[POR08]
I sensed that she had
an aura of strong magic
about her...[BRK]

[POR10]
Maybe we should take her
advice and check it out...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, this is just great! Some
weird girl comes out of 
nowhere,[BRK]

and we're gonna take her
advice and follow her
through some spook house![BRK]

This is just going to make
my week![END]

=== b | a512 | 94 ===
This gate is to remain
sealed until the monsters
threatening us are defeated.[BRK]

Don't worry, Lord Leo will
be here soon to take care of
the situation.[END]

=== c | a5ba | 75 ===
It was strange. All of the
monsters disappeared very
suddenly.[BRK]

Maybe they heard that Lord
Leo was coming...Ha ha ha![END]

=== d | a63e | 8f ===
Now that the danger has
passed, this gate is open
for all to use.[BRK]

[POR02]
You turned awfully helpful
all of the sudden. Are you
the same gatekeeper?[END]

=== e | a6dc | 10a ===
Fearsome monsters have been
coming into the village
lately.[BRK]

That's why we sealed the
north gate.[BRK]

If we don't open the gate,
they can't get in anymore.[BRK]

The only problem is that
the north gate leads the
way to Nota.[BRK]

And until the monsters are
defeated, we're cut off.[END]

=== f | a7fe | d3 ===
I wish I knew the source of
those strange monsters![BRK]

I think it's that strange
hooded figure that arrived
about the same time.[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, Hiro, that's the hooded
figure we talked to![BRK]

I don't like the smell of
this...[END]

=== 10 | a8e8 | 13c ===
I wish I knew the source of
those strange monsters![BRK]

Now there's a girl named
Lemina scamming strangers.[BRK]

She tells them she knows a
way around the town and
charges them for the info![BRK]

[POR02]
What!?[BRK]

[POR07]
Hey! It was not a scam![BRK]

It was a test for applicants
to the Magic Guild![BRK]

...And the money was used to 
restore the Guild![END]

=== 11 | aa34 | 64 ===
I heard that the monsters
were made by the Magic
Guild.[BRK]

I wonder who started that
ridiculous rumor?![END]

=== 12 | aaa6 | 41 ===
[POR02]
I think it was Lemina.[BRK]

[POR07]
It was not, you little
flying stain![END]

=== 13 | aaf6 | 6f ===
There's a hooded figure
lurking around town.[BRK]

You'd better not talk to it.
If you do accidentally, come
to me...[END]

=== 14 | ab7c | 2c ===
Remember, don't talk to the
hooded figure...[END]

=== 15 | abb2 | 28 ===
There it is! Whatever you
do, stay away![END]

=== 16 | abe4 | 8e ===
You talked to the hooded
figure, didn't you?[BRK]

You're doomed now! She's
going to stalk you forever![BRK]

Your only hope is to run,
run, run far away![END]

=== 17 | ac8e | b0 ===
Now that you've talked to
the hooded figure, your
only hope is to run away![BRK]

Run, run, run! If she finds
you again, she'll...she'll
...I don't know what![BRK]

But it'll be terrible![END]

=== 18 | ad56 | a7 ===
You're lucky the hooded
girl disappeared![BRK]

I heard she is a member of
the old Vane Magic Guild.[BRK]

One thing's for sure: she's
really annoying. If you see
her, be careful.[END]

=== 19 | ae14 | 13c ===
Hey! Aren't you the girl
that was going about town
in a cloak?[BRK]

Are you really the Premier
of the Vane Magic Guild?[BRK]

[POR07]
I'm surprised you even have
to ask![BRK]

Can't you tell from my
classic good looks and
superior intellect?[BRK]

Of course I'm the Premier of
the Guild, idiot![BRK]

...Well, actually the Junior
Premier...but still![END]

=== 1a | af68 | 78 ===
I'm surprised you're all
still okay. That Magic
Guild master is weird.[BRK]

I thought she might do
something terrible to you![END]

=== 1b | aff8 | bc ===
What!? You're still hanging
around that weird Premier of
the Magic Guild?[BRK]

You'd better keep a close
eye on her![BRK]

[POR07]
Why should they do that?
You're the weirdo. We should
keep an eye on you![END]

=== 1c | b0c8 | bd ===
I can't believe that girl is
the Premier of the Vane
Magic Guild.[BRK]

I mean, I knew they were
hard up, but now they're
employing kids?[BRK]

Oh well, I guess you can't
judge a person by their
looks.[END]

=== 1d | b198 | fb ===
Are you sure you're the
Premier of the Magic Guild?
...THE Vane Magic Guild?[BRK]

[POR07]
Of course I am. How many
times do I have to tell you?[BRK]

You should be able to see it
just by observing my mastery
of complicated magic,...[BRK]

And my impeccable social
graces...[END]

=== 1e | b2a2 | 90 ===
P-Please...Have mercy on me,
for I...I have no magic
ability![BRK]

[POR02]
What the heck's wrong with
this bozo? It seems like
he's afraid of something...[END]

=== 1f | b34a | 68 ===
No...no....no! Get away from
me! I told you to leave
...me...alone![BRK]

Ahhhh! Leave me alone...
please![END]

=== 20 | b3bc | 51 ===
[POR02]
What's wrong with that guy?
He's acting like he's seen
a ghost or something...[END]

=== 21 | b428 | 44 ===
Please! Stop following me!
I...I can't take it
anymore![BRK]

Heeelllppp![END]

=== 22 | b484 | 60 ===
I was a fool for fearing
that stupid hooded girl in
the first place.[BRK]

I dunno what got into me...[END]

=== 23 | b4fc | 10b ===
Oh...Oh no! You're the
hooded girl, aren't you![BRK]

Please! Ya gotta leave me
alone! I don't know why you
keep stalking me![BRK]

[POR08]
Why is this man so very
afraid of Lemina? I don't
understand...[BRK]

[POR07]
Me neither. A lot of people
in this town are afraid of
me for some reason...[END]

=== 24 | b61a | 80 ===
Ohhhh...oh...The trial
at the manor...it was
terrible.[BRK]

I still have nightmares
about it...The place is
haunted now, you know.[END]

=== 25 | b6a8 | 66 ===
[POR07]
You are such a lightweight.
I'm glad you failed my
little test at the manor...[BRK]

Talk about a baby...[END]

=== 26 | b71c | 3f ===
[POR05]
Well, some people got it,
and some people don't![BRK]

He don't...[END]

=== 27 | b76e | 95 ===
I've been having nightmares
from that stupid trial at
the manor forever![BRK]

Now that the world is at
peace, maybe I'll finally
get a good night's sleep.[END]

=== 28 | b81a | dd ===
Why, why, why?! Stop buggin'
me, lady![BRK]

I almost had forgotten about
that cockamamie trial at the
manor, and you show up![BRK]

[POR07]
Well, I can give you one
more chance to pass a Magic
Trial...[BRK]

[POR00]
No, no, no! Just leave me
alone![END]

=== 29 | b912 | 48 ===
I finally got a good night's
sleep.[BRK]

I hope the nightmares are
over...[END]

=== 2a | b96a | 91 ===
My son is such a stupid boy!
He falls for a strange magic
girl, and now look at him![BRK]

He went into the haunted
manor to try to impress her.
Idiot![END]

=== 2b | ba12 | b1 ===
The girl who made him take
a trial at the manor is
crazy![BRK]

I heard she's charging
admission to take the test!
Can you believe that?![BRK]

And my son was dumb enough
to fall for it...[END]

=== 2c | bada | 85 ===
If my son was dumb enough
to get caught in that girl's
trap,[BRK]

you might be in danger, too.
Be careful of that girl, I'm
warning you...[END]

=== 2d | bb72 | 67 ===
That girl is obsessed by
money![BRK]

I don't think she has any
connection to the Magic
Guild of Vane at all![END]

=== 2e | bbe6 | a0 ===
[POR07]
That's what you get for
thinking![BRK]

Of course I'm associated
with the Guild...I'm the
Junior Premier![BRK]

[POR02]
But premier of what? That
place is really run-down...[END]

=== 2f | bc96 | 8f ===
Now that there's peace in
the land, my son seems to
be getting better.[BRK]

I'm so thankful! I don't
know how much more of his
whining I could take![END]

=== 30 | bd34 | a8 ===
You'd better be careful. I
just heard there's strange
monsters roaming about.[BRK]

And a hooded figure has
been seen around town...[BRK]

Beware the moors...that's
what I say...[END]

=== 31 | bdf0 | 64 ===
I don't believe that the
girl in the cloak is the
Premier of Vane.[BRK]

She's too flighty...too
weird...[END]

=== 32 | be68 | 92 ===
I wish I knew how to help
you out, but I don't.[BRK]

So you might as well just
stop bothering me.[BRK]

It's really quite annoying.[BRK]

I mean it![BRK]

Are you deaf?[END]

=== 33 | bf0e | 78 ===
I heard about the happenings
at the Ghost Manor.[BRK]

So, the monster was a fake,
huh? That seems almost too
good to be true.[END]

=== 34 | bf96 | b7 ===
My my my! How you kids have
grown since the last time
you were here.[BRK]

Seems like that was just
yesterday...[BRK]

[POR02]
That's probably because
you're getting senile as you
approach middle age.[END]

=== 35 | c060 | b9 ===
Say there, strangers! Have
you decided on a place to
stay while you're here?[BRK]

Tell you what! I'll make you
a great deal on a room! It's
only 10s![BRK]

And best of all, breakfast
is included![END]

=== 36 | c130 | 4b ===
All the best-looking women
stay at my hotel. Why don't
you stay there, too?[END]

=== 37 | c188 | c0 ===
[POR05]
Hey Chief, this sounds like
a pretty sweet deal![BRK]

10s per night, free
breakfast, and curvy scenery
that's easy on the eyes![BRK]

[POR02]
Whoa there, Ronfar! Rein in
the stallion! We've got
work to do![END]

=== 38 | c25c | 70 ===
Say, have you decided to
stay at the Bounteous Babe
Hotel?[BRK]

[POR02]
No, we've got work to do.
Maybe some other time...[END]

=== 39 | c2e4 | 99 ===
Now that the monsters have
disappeared, the trade route
from Nota is open.[BRK]

Our hotel is almost filled
to capacity. You'd better
hurry if you want a room![END]

=== 3a | c38a | 9c ===
[POR05]
Oh, man! C'mon, Hiro! Can't
we just stay one night? I
mean, sheesh...the babes...[BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, you know we can't
stop here now, so why do
you keep asking?![END]

=== 3b | c442 | 98 ===
If you try to do battle when
your bodies are deprived of
sleep, it's dangerous.[BRK]

Why not spend the night at
the Bounteous Babe? We've
got free breakfast![END]

=== 3c | c4ea | 85 ===
Now that the world is at
peace once again, business
is up 500% over last year.[BRK]

I'm thinking of expanding
the hotel! Isn't that great?[END]

=== 3d | c580 | bf ===
[POR05]
So does that mean there will
be more Bounteous Babes to
check out...Hoouuahhh![BRK]

[POR09]
Ronfar, you better cool it,
or I'll tell Mauri![BRK]

If she finds out how you've
been acting, you're dead
meat![END]

=== 3e | c64e | 8a ===
I failed the trial at the
Ghost Manor because I was
not good with magic.[BRK]

Those flying girls are 
impossible! I couldn't even
scratch them![END]

=== 3f | c6ec | 62 ===
Oh no! There she is...It's
that girl...that terrible
girl![BRK]

Oh no...I think she's after
you now...[END]

=== 40 | c762 | b6 ===
I feel sorry for you if the
hooded girl is after you.[BRK]

She won't stop stalking you
until you take her test at
the Ghost Manor![BRK]

It's horrible in there! Just
a big nightmare....Ouuuggh![END]

=== 41 | c82c | 83 ===
I've heard many rumors about
the Ghost Manor lately.[BRK]

Some say that it wasn't real
at all, but just put there
to test magic ability.[END]

=== 42 | c8be | 9e ===
The hooded girl from the
Ghost Manor is rumored to be
premier of the Magic Guild.[BRK]

But if she was the Premier,
she wouldn't do something
like that, would she?[END]

=== 43 | c96a | 20 ===
[POR07]
I'm sure she had her
reasons.[END]

=== 44 | c99e | be ===
You know what? Huh? Huh?
Huh?[BRK]

I met the Premier of the
Magic Guild of Vane![BRK]

When I grow up, I want to be
in the Magic Guild.[BRK]

But it costs a lot, so I'm
gonna start saving my money
right now![END]

=== 45 | ca74 | 32 ===
When I get bigger, I'm gonna
join the Magic Guild![END]

=== 46 | caba | 78 ===
I used to want to be a
world-class trader, but
I've changed my mind.[BRK]

Now, I just want to be a
member of the Magic Guild![END]

=== 47 | cb40 | 72 ===
[POR07]
Well, remember, you have to
have a lot of money to enter
into the Magic Guild.[BRK]

So you better start saving
now![END]

=== 48 | cbc6 | 7a ===
I need money to become a
member of the Magic Guild,
so I'm saving my earnings.[BRK]

Hopefully, I'll have enough
when I grow up.[END]

=== 49 | cc4e | a4 ===
[POR07]
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'll give you this savings
book.[BRK]

That way, you can deposit
your savings with me![BRK]

I'll keep them in a special
account until you get big![END]

=== 4a | cd02 | 6a ===
I've saved lots of money
to get into the Guild
when I get big.[BRK]

But I still don't have
enough to join yet.[END]

=== 4b | cd7a | 44 ===
[POR07]
Well, why don't you give it
to me, so I can keep it safe
for you?[END]

=== 4c | cdce | 86 ===
A strange girl who called
herself the Premier of the
Magic Guild was just here.[BRK]

I don't know what she could
possibly want around here.[END]

=== 4d | ce6c | bf ===
That girl who calls herself
the Premier of the Magic
Guild is strange.[BRK]

I think she likes money way
too much.[BRK]

What's the relationship
between magic and money?
Is there one?[BRK]

I don't think so...[END]

=== 4e | cf46 | 50 ===
I don't understand why that
Magic Guild girl makes such
a big deal out of money.[END]

=== 4f | cfaa | 50 ===
I haven't seen the Premier
of the Money Grubbers Guild.
I wonder where she went?[END]

=== 50 | d008 | 6b ===
[POR07]
That's the Magic Guild, not
the Money Grubbers Guild![BRK]

[POR02]
...Hehe...I think he has
you pegged, Lemina.[END]

=== 51 | d082 | 70 ===
Hrmph! I guess the Money
Grubbers premier saved the
world, didn't she?[BRK]

Maybe my opinion of her was
misguided...[END]

=== 52 | d100 | 2a ===
[POR07]
That's Magic Guild, not
money grubbers![END]

=== 53 | d13a | 5a ===
Hmmm...New travelers...[BRK]

...You poor, poor, souls.[BRK]

[POR02]
Poor souls? What is he
talking about?[END]

=== 54 | d1ac | 9a ===
You aren't friends of the
cloaked figure, are you?[BRK]

It's been looking this way
ever since you came.[BRK]

I don't envy you...[BRK]

[POR02]
Why? What are you talking
about?[END]

=== 55 | d262 | a9 ===
That cloaked girl seems to
be very fond of you.[BRK]

That can be quite dangerous.
I wouldn't want to be in
your shoes...[BRK]

[POR02]
Will you please tell me what
you're talking about?[END]

=== 56 | d322 | f2 ===
Not too long ago, I believed
what the girl said and took
her test.[BRK]

It was a nerve-shattering
experience that I don't
care to relive.[BRK]

I still have nightmares
about it to this day.[BRK]

To add insult to injury, 
she took money from me as
a test fee![END]

=== 57 | d430 | e6 ===
Aren't you the...[BRK]

[POR07]
Yep! I'm Lemina, premier of
the Magic Guild.[BRK]

Sorry you didn't have what
it takes to be a member of
the Magic Guild.[BRK]

Maybe you can try again
someday![BRK]

[POR00]
Are you kidding? Never!
I've had my fill of magic
tests![END]

=== 58 | d536 | 70 ===
After that terrible
experience with the Magic
Trial, [BRK]

I have no desire to be
anything other than a 
tradesman...[END]

=== 59 | d5b6 | 27 ===
Yep, the simple life's the
best life...[END]

=== 5a | d5e2 | e ===
Takkar Village[END]

=== 5b | ed26 | e ===
Donated 100s.[END]

=== 5c | ed62 | 125 ===
There has been much
commotion in the village
lately.[BRK]

Villagers are afraid of all
the monsters that have come
to our village.[BRK]

But we of the Althena Cult
will destroy the monsters
using Althena's power.[BRK]

If donations increase, Lord
Leo will come and slay the
monsters![BRK]

Now then, will you donate?[END]

=== 5d | ee9e | 7c ===
The world is safest under
the watch of Althena's
Cult members.[BRK]

The sooner you realize this,
the better it will be for
you...[END]

=== 5e | ef2e | 7e ===
What? The monsters have all
disappeared from the area?[BRK]

Hmm...Well then, the power
of Althena's Cult is greater
than I thought![END]

=== 5f | efba | 4f ===
[POR02]
It wasn't you...it was...[BRK]

[POR07]
Shh! Ruby! Be quiet! They
don't need to know![END]

=== 60 | f018 | 9e ===
Now that you have shown the
error of our ways, we are
humbled before the village.[BRK]

The people look upon us very
suspiciously. I hope we can
regain their trust.[END]

=== 61 | f0c6 | 78 ===
Welcome to Takkar. Make a
donation and pray for safe
travel, won't you?[BRK]

If you do not, grave things
could happen to you.[END]

=== 62 | f152 | 6d ===
You should donate to the
Goddess Althena before you
travel.[BRK]

That way, she can watch over
you on your journey.[END]

=== 63 | f1cc | 106 ===
[POR07]
I think this money would be
put to better use at the
Magic Guild.[BRK]

People should start donating
to the Magic Guild instead.[BRK]

Then the Guild can make
this world safe again for
everyone.[BRK]

[POR00]
Blasphemy! You dare to speak
against the leadership of
Althena herself?![END]

=== 64 | f2e2 | 99 ===
We were following the wrong
path. Goddess Althena would
not be so money-hungry.[BRK]

It was our own selfish
desire that led us to ask
for so many donations...[END]

=== 65 | f38a | 87 ===
Isn't this shrine the most
beautiful place you've ever
seen?[BRK]

If you want a long life and
much happiness, donate to
the Goddess Althena.[END]

=== 66 | f424 | 46 ===
For a life free from worry
about money, donate to the
Goddess Althena.[END]

=== 67 | f478 | 52 ===
[POR07]
I was thinking that an IRA
would be a more prudent
investment.[BRK]

Don't you think?[END]

=== 68 | f4da | 65 ===
Don't you want to keep this
shrine this beautiful?[BRK]

Well then, you'd better
donate to Goddess Althena![END]

=== 69 | f552 | 80 ===
In my former life, I was a
tradesman, but then I felt
the calling.[BRK]

Now I am a servant to the
Cult of Althena. Donation,
please?[END]

=== 6a | f5ea | 7c ===
When I quit my former life,
I gave all my assets to the
Althena Cult.[BRK]

I live now only to collect
more donations for Althena.[END]

=== 6b | f674 | 4d ===
[POR07]
You what? You gave all your
property to these kooks? I
can't believe it...[END]

=== 6c | f6d0 | 5c ===
The donation you give is not
as important as the prayer
you pray.[BRK]

But the minimum is 1000s.[END]

=== 6d | f73c | 80 ===
We are trying our best to
spread the word of Althena,[BRK]

but there are many that
still want to sing, dance,
and make money instead.[END]

=== 6e | f7ca | 36 ===
[POR10]
But I thought Althena loved
singing and dancing...[END]

=== 6f | f80e | 6b ===
[POR07]
That's right! And I bet she
loved money, too![BRK]

[POR02]

too far out on that limb...[END]

Now I understand the true
teachings of Althena.[BRK]

She wants all of us to enjoy
life by singing and dancing
to lift our spirits.[END]

Many of the villagers don't
believe what we tell them
of Goddess Althena.[BRK]

Someday, the Goddess will
come and punish them for
their ignorance![END]

=== 72 | f9b4 | 89 ===
We of the Althena Cult try
to steer the people in the
right way.[BRK]

Those that will not donate
to the cause will be
punished by the Goddess.[END]

=== 73 | fa4c | 7f ===
Now I know that Althena,
goddess of beauty and love,
wouldn't punish us.[BRK]

Who started that doctrine?
It seems like nonsense now![END]

[POR20]
Welcome, travelers![BRK]

I am a messenger from the
Magic Guild of Vane. We are
recruiting new members.[BRK]

Would you like to join the
Guild? There's only a simple
test, and an entrance fee.[BRK]

[POR02]
Hey, Hiro, that sounds like
fun. Why don't we take the
test?[BRK]

[POR20]
Oh, pooh! I forgot to tell
you we don't allow flying
cats.[BRK]

I always forget that...[BRK]

[POR02]
Well then, that's still okay
since I'm not a cat.[BRK]

[POR20]
...But...you look like a cat
with...[BRK]

[POR05]
Hey sister, hate to break up
the raging kitty debate, but
we've got to get moving.[BRK]

We don't have time to take
your test...[BRK]

[POR20]
Ah, yes, but you cannot pass
the gate to continue your
quest, anyway.[BRK]

Haven't you heard? The gate
is sealed because of
terrible monster attacks![BRK]

[POR10]
Then we'll tell the guard
we can kill the monsters if
he opens the gate.[BRK]

[POR20]
....
.....[BRK]

Perhaps that plan will work,
or maybe it won't. You can
only try...[BRK]

...In any event, I'll be
around...[END]

=== 76 | 10ca8 | d7 ===
[POR02]
Whew! Talk about your hood
fetish kooks! That girl was
a mountain of weird![BRK]

I mean...offering us a test
to enter the Magic Guild,
and then excluding me?[BRK]

What kind of attitude is
that? Gimme a break![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[END]

=== 77 | 10d92 | 7c ===
It's my job to transport
goods from Nota to Dalton.[BRK]

I always like to stop in at
this bar for a little R&R
before I continue.[END]

=== 78 | 10e22 | fa ===
My usual route is from Nota
to Dalton, but I just heard
about a town called Larpa.[BRK]

They say it's just past
Dalton...[BRK]

I was thinkin' about goin'
down there to see if I can
expand my service route.[BRK]

Any of you guys heard about
what it's like down there?[END]

=== 79 | 10f2a | c8 ===
[POR05]
Let me get my dice and I'll
show ya, Chief![BRK]

[POR02]
Whoa! Put those things away,
Ronfar![BRK]

Mister, you don't want to
learn about Larpa from
Ronfar.[BRK]

It'll be the most expensive
travelogue you've ever seen![END]

=== 7a | 11002 | d6 ===
Now that the world is at
peace, I was thinkin' about
settling down here.[BRK]

I mean, the location's nice,
and whoa! Did you see the
Bounteous Babe Hotel?[BRK]

We're talking some righteous
bounty![BRK]

Yeah...I could live here...[END]

=== 7b | 110e8 | 96 ===
Now that the gates have been
closed, our business is
going to die out.[BRK]

I sure hope they get those
monsters killed in a hurry,
or we're in big trouble![END]

=== 7c | 11192 | 5b ===
At least the wine supply
from Nota is back on
schedule again![BRK]

That blockade was killing
us![END]

=== 7d | 111fc | 9b ===
Now that the world is safe
again, sales of flowers and
champagne are up.[BRK]

Fortunately, I saw it coming
and stocked up. I'm making
a killing![BRK]

Cheers to Hiro![END]

The Althena Cult is making
a business out of the fear
of these monsters.[BRK]

I don't know how the Goddess
can allow them to do that![END]

=== 82 | 114f2 | 38 ===
[POR10]
I'm sure she won't allow it
for long...[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[END]

=== 83 | 11542 | a8 ===
The cult leaders are getting
to be real sticklers![BRK]

Now they say that alcohol,
song, and dance are off-
limits to followers![BRK]

Kevin Bacon, where are you
when we need you?[END]

=== 84 | 115fe | a8 ===
Now that the Althena Cult
members got the monsters
under control,[BRK]

they're saying that it's a
sign that the Goddess
approves of their teachings![BRK]

I can't believe it's so.[END]

=== 85 | 116b6 | 85 ===
The followers of Goddess
Althena have changed
dramatically.[BRK]

Now, they enjoy song and
dance. In fact, they're
starting some festivals![END]

=== 86 | 11748 | 6b ===
[POR10]
That sounds more like the
Althena I heard about as
a child.[BRK]

The one that inspired me
to become a dancer.[END]

=== 87 | 117c6 | 5a ===
Say there, strangers!
Haven't seen you in here
before.[BRK]

Where ya from? Nota?
Dalton? Larpa?[END]

[POR08]
My name is Lucia. I have
come from the Blue Star.[BRK]

[POR00]
Well then, you've come
mighty far. Perhaps you'd
like some Dutch apple pie?[END]

=== 89 | 118c2 | 87 ===
[POR05]
Hehe...The girl's just
having some fun with you!
Actually, we're from Larpa.[BRK]

We're on a tour of the area!
We'll be seein' ya...[END]

=== 8a | 1195c | e3 ===
Ya know, your talk about the
Blue Star reminded me of a
legend I heard 'bout it.[BRK]

They say that long ago, our
ancestors came from the Blue
Star, courtesy of Althena.[BRK]

Don't know if it's true, but
it's a mighty romantic
notion....[END]

=== 8b | 11a4c | c5 ===
[POR08]
What you speak is not
legend, but history. It
really happened long ago...[BRK]

[POR00]
Now how in the world would
you know that?[BRK]

Oh, I get it...you're
pullin' my leg again! Ha ha!
Good one...Ya got me![END]

=== 8c | 11b24 | fe ===
Say there, folks...sit down
and take a load off.[BRK]

I'll buy the first round of
drinks to show some good
ol' Takkar hospitality![BRK]

[POR02]
Thanks for the heapin'
helpin' of your hospitality,
but we have to get moving.[BRK]

[POR00]
Okay then, but y'all come
back now, y'hear?[END]

=== 8d | 11c46 | f4 ===
I heard there is a way to
get back to the Blue Star.
It's in some tower...[BRK]

Ahhh...what a romantic
notion! Traveling to the
Blue Star...ouoummmmm...[BRK]

If only that dream could
come true![BRK]

[POR02]
I'm sure it will come true
if you're a dreamer like
Hiro![END]

Thanks for taking a look

Ah! Have you come to upgrade
your armor? That's not a bad
idea these days,[BRK]

what with all the monsters
running around mauling
innocent folk.[BRK]

So, tell me, what can I do
for you?[END]

It's been a pleasure serving

Thank you! Thank you! Come

Takkar Item Shop[END]

=== 97 | 13776 | 89 ===
Say, you look like you're
new to this town. At least
you picked a good inn![BRK]

I'm a traveling merchant.
Do you want to see any of
my wares?[END]

=== 98 | 1380c | a7 ===
[POR08]
Merchant? Wares? I don't
understand the meaning of
those words...[BRK]

[POR02]
If you remain ignorant of
those terms and credit-
cardless,[BRK]

you'll be every man's
fantasy mate![END]

=== 99 | 138ca | 45 ===
Someday, I'm going to be the
most successful merchant in
all history![END]

=== 9a | 13922 | 8e ===
With a little more work, I'm
going to set up my own shop
in Takkar.[BRK]

That's step two in my dream
to be the most successful
merchant in history.[END]

=== 9b | 139be | 5c ===
[POR07]
Sorry, buster. I think that
title goes to me...[BRK]

...if selling guild
memberships counts...[END]

=== 9c | 13a2a | 67 ===
This inn is cheap and quite
clean.[BRK]

If I'm going to make my
dream come true, I have to
save where I can![END]

=== 9d | 13a9e | 73 ===
[POR07]
I'm pretty sure Ramus and
Ramus Jr. of Meribia are
the most successful...[BRK]

It's going to be tough to
beat them...[END]

=== 9e | 13b20 | fd ===
Many people come here
because they like the
town's atmosphere.[BRK]

Once, long ago, I came to
this town and liked it so
much I set up this inn![BRK]

Best decision I ever made.[BRK]

I mean, it's just a tiny bed
and breakfast inn, but it's
my dream,[BRK]

and I'm living it...[END]

Lord Leo and his men were
looking for some people they
said stopped by my inn.[BRK]

Have you seen any unusual
looking visitors?[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh...no! No, we haven't
seen any...thing out of the
ordinary...[END]

Welcome to the Bounteous
Babe Inn. We're here to
serve your every need.[END]

[POR08]
But...their faces are the
same??? I've never seen
anything like it...[BRK]

[POR02]
We call that 'twins.'[END]

=== a4 | 14574 | 9c ===
This inn is very popular
with the traveling merchants
in the area.[BRK]

They all like to stay here
when they have business in
Takkar.[BRK]

I think they like the view.[END]

=== a5 | 14624 | df ===
My sister and I started this
inn when we noticed all the
travelers in town.[BRK]

Since most of them were
merchants,[BRK]

we knew a name like
'Bounteous Babe' would get
their attention.[BRK]

So, what do you say? Want to
give our inn a try?[END]

=== a6 | 14718 | 7e ===
[POR05]
Well sugarplum, that's the
closest thing to a direct
invite I could hope for![BRK]

What do you say, Chief?
Let's check it out...[END]

=== a7 | 147a4 | 4f ===
[POR07]
I think we'd better pass.
We're saving money, and this
inn is too expensive![END]

=== a8 | 1480a | 51 ===
This is the most popular inn
in the village. Sometimes,
even villagers stay here![END]

=== a9 | 1486a | 13a ===
Now that we've conquered the
market in this area, we're
thinking of expansion.[BRK]

If the franchise deal goes
through,[BRK]

there'll be a 'Bounteous
Babe Inn' at every village
in the world![BRK]

Then, when we're stinking
rich, we can devote our time
to the women's movement.[BRK]

Don't you think men demean
women terribly these days?[END]

=== aa | 149b4 | fa ===
Whenever my business takes
me near this town, I always
stay here.[BRK]

This place is always stocked
with the most gorgeous
women! Talk about eye candy![BRK]

Whoooo whee![BRK]

[POR02]
Yeah, but in your case it's
more like phee-yeww![BRK]

Your looks are more like
eye sewage...[END]

Now that my business is
concluded in town, I've got
to go home.[BRK]

I sure wish I could take one
of those hot chicks home
with me tonight! Wow![BRK]

[POR02]
Two words:[BRK]

personal[BRK]

hygiene...[BRK]

Look it up, and maybe
someday you'll stand a
chance.[END]

=== ac | 14bb4 | fd ===
I decided to stay here a
while longer to try to get
to know the women here.[BRK]

You...think I have a chance
with the younger of the two
chicks that own this joint?[BRK]

She's pretty hot, huh?[BRK]

[POR02]
And...you're pretty cold.[BRK]

...And stinky. Here's a
dime, buy a clue.[END]

=== ad | 14cc0 | 80 ===
Even though I live in this
village, I stay here at the
inn sometimes.[BRK]

I'm hoping one of the women
will notice me and ask me
out.[END]

That woman over there is so
beautiful...like a delicate
rose.[BRK]

My heart belongs to her, and
she doesn't even know it.[END]

Now that the world is at
peace, the only tempest that
remains is in my heart.[BRK]

My love for the woman over
there goes unnoticed. She
doesn't even know I'm alive![BRK]

To love and have not is
torturing my weary soul...[END]

Takkar B. Babe Inn[END]

Ever since the gate was
closed, my inn has been
packed.[BRK]

We have the lowest-priced
rooms in town, and since
no one can pass the gate,[BRK]

they just stay here and 
wait this monster situation
out.[END]

=== b2 | 1574c | ab ===
I'm so glad the monster
situation has eased up![BRK]

I mean, I liked the extra
business from stranded
travelers,[BRK]

but the threat of danger
hanging over our heads was
killing me![END]

=== b3 | 1580a | 154 ===
You know, it's amazing. The
more people care about each
other, the more they fight.[BRK]

It seems to be some sort of
unwritten law.[BRK]

Take, for example, that
couple over there. They love
each other,[BRK]

but they've been bickering
ever since they got here.[BRK]

[POR02]
That's not always true! Nall
and I fight all the time, 
and we don't...[BRK]

...Uh, never mind.[END]

=== b4 | 15976 | 8d ===
That couple over there are
always bickering about
little things.[BRK]

But I think they really
love each other.[BRK]

He bought her roses the
other day.[END]

=== b5 | 15a12 | b9 ===
Harold! You told me that
this trip would be an
exciting affair![BRK]

I'm nothing but tired and
bored! Sitting in this
lousy hotel isn't helping![BRK]

...Harold? Are you listening
to me?!! Harold![END]

=== b6 | 15ade | 9a ===
Harold! Harold! This
disaster was all your idea![BRK]

And it's nothing but a bore!
I never want to go on one
of these trips again![BRK]

Got that?[BRK]

.....Never!!!!!!!![END]

=== b7 | 15b88 | 73 ===
I don't know why I listened
to you, Harold![BRK]

I knew this trip was a bad
idea from the moment you
asked me to go![END]

=== b8 | 15c0e | 8d ===
Now that the gate is closed,
my wife and I can't get on
with our trip.[BRK]

I was planning on taking her
to the carnival, but now, I
don't know...[END]

=== b9 | 15cb2 | 4a ===
I can't believe my rotten
luck. My wife's complaining
is driving me crazy![END]

=== ba | 15d10 | ee ===
Even though the gate is open
again, I think we're too low
on money to continue.[BRK]

This time waiting out the
monster situation has almost
drained us.[BRK]

Oohhmmm...My wife's gonna
kill me...[BRK]

Maybe I can calm her down
by getting her some roses...[END]
