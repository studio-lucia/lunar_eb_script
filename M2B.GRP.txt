...I can't believe you
finally made it...[BRK]

I was beginning to think
you were a lost cause...[END]

What??...Nall!?![BRK]

How did you do that!?[BRK]

[POR11]
It's not important.
...Doesn't matter.[BRK]

Now that you're finally
here, my Dragonpower can
be released at last.[BRK]

You must throw the Dragon
Aura directly at the
crystal.[BRK]

Once the Aura touches the
crystal, the seal will be
shattered,[BRK]

...and my Dragonpower will
be released!![END]

Aura at the crystal![END]

Nall, you make quite a
handsome White Dragon.[BRK]

Say, can the other seals be
broken in this same manner?[BRK]

[POR24]
Yes, but you must have the
correct Dragon Aura for
each seal.[BRK]

Ghaleon made certain that
the Dragon Aura was the only
way to unlock them.[BRK]

You should unlock the Blue
Dragon's power next.[BRK]

Lunn is guarding its aura
at the training city of
Horam to the south.[BRK]

The way is treacherous, but
I will melt some of the ice-
bergs blocking your path.[BRK]

Oh, and here...I'll leave
you something to help you
on your way...[BRK]

Good luck...[END]

Lucia, you're right. Nall
is really quite a handsome
White Dragon.[BRK]

Too bad he's such a pain
in the butt...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Hmmmm...Maybe there is hope
for him...[BRK]

But I can't leave Hiro....
what would he do without
me...??[END]

Ha! You got the White Dragon
Aura from Leo at last![BRK]

[POR02]
Hey, Nall! Where in the heck
are you?[BRK]

[POR11]
I'm where you need to be![BRK]

Listen, you need the four
ice treasures to open the
passage to my lair.[BRK]

Once you've got those, you
may have to backtrack a bit,
but the way will be open.[BRK]

Each one is in a big white
ice chest in the corners of
this cave.[BRK]

Hurry up and get them. I'll
be waiting...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

And I don't like waiting.[END]
