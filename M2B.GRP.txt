...i can't believe you
finally made it...[BRK]

I was beginning to think
you were a lost cause...[END]

What??...nall!?![BRK]

How did you do that!?[BRK]

[POR11]
It's not important.
...doesn't matter.[BRK]

Now that you're finally
here, my dragonpower can
be released at last.[BRK]

You must throw the dragon
aura directly at the
crystal.[BRK]

Once the aura touches the
crystal, the seal will be
shattered,[BRK]

...and my dragonpower will
be released!!

Nall, you make quite a
handsome white dragon.[BRK]

Say, can the other seals be
broken in this same manner?[BRK]

[POR24]
Yes, but you must have the
correct dragon aura for
each seal.[BRK]

Ghaleon made certain that
the dragon aura was the only
way to unlock them.[BRK]

You should unlock the blue
dragon's power next.[BRK]

Lunn is guarding its aura
at the training city of
horam to the south.[BRK]

The way is treacherous, but
i will melt some of the ice-
bergs blocking your path.[BRK]

Oh, and here...i'll leave
you something to help you
on your way...[BRK]

Good luck...[END]

Lucia, you're right. Nall
is really quite a handsome
white dragon.[BRK]

Too bad he's such a pain
in the butt...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Hmmmm...maybe there is hope
for him...[BRK]

But i can't leave hiro....
what would he do without
me...??[END]

Ha! You got the white dragon
aura from leo at last![BRK]

[POR02]
Hey, nall! Where in the heck
are you?[BRK]

[POR11]
I'm where you need to be![BRK]

Listen, you need the four
ice treasures to open the
passage to my lair.[BRK]

Once you've got those, you
may have to backtrack a bit,
but the way will be open.[BRK]

Each one is in a big white
ice chest in the corners of
this cave.[BRK]

Hurry up and get them. I'll
be waiting...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

And i don't like waiting.
