Welcome to the town of
horam! We're located in
western katarina.[BRK]

South of here lies the
maruis zone.[BRK]

I'd stay away from there, if
i were you. Why don't you
stay here and learn karate?[END]

=== 1 | 887e | 113 ===
Congratulations![BRK]

I heard that you guys won
the competition.[BRK]

So tell me, did you make 
anyone cry when you pounded
their face in?[BRK]

Did you let them up when 
they begged for mercy, or
did you finish them off?[BRK]

You must've been ruthless in
there, otherwise you never
would've won.[END]

=== 2 | 89ac | cd ===
Hey, remember! I'm on your
side - so just leave me
alone.[BRK]

I don't want to get on your
bad side, okay?[BRK]

...i can't believe you won 
against lunn.[BRK]

The only person i would've
thought could beat him was
otto...[END]

=== 3 | 8a88 | 7b ===
Only the best karate masters
stay in horam.[BRK]

If you're not able to defend
yourself, you better walk
out the way you came in.[END]

=== 4 | 8b16 | af ===
....
.....???[BRK]

I...i'm not scared![BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro, look at this guy. He's
shaking like he's just seen
a ghost![BRK]

[POR00]
I'm training my mind to
suppress fear.[BRK]

I'm deathly afraid of
heights.[END]

=== 5 | 8bdc | 82 ===
I suffer from acrophobia.
You know, the fear of 
heights.[BRK]

[POR02]
Well, i'm not aco...
acropohob....[BRK]

I mean, i'm not scared of
heights.[END]

=== 6 | 8c76 | 6b ===
Man, just standing here is
making me dizzy...[BRK]

I must control my fear! 
Oh no! I think i'm going
to be sick.[END]

=== 7 | 8cfc | 47 ===
I must conquer my fear.
Otherwise, i'll never become
a karate master.

[END]

=== 8 | 8d56 | f4 ===
I've got a great idea!![BRK]

Why don't i get on that 
cat's back, and it can fly
up to the top of that house.[BRK]

I'll stay there and try to
get over my fear of heights![BRK]

[POR02]
No, i've got a better idea.[BRK]

How 'bout i fly you over
to the sea and drop you in?[END]

=== 9 | 8e62 | 32 ===
Man, i don't know if i'll
ever get over this fear![END]

=== a | 8ea8 | cf ===
I can't believe how many 
schools teach karate in this
town.[BRK]

This is going to be a tough
decision. I wish there 
weren't so many choices.[BRK]

Maybe i should find out
which dojo won the com-
petition last year...[END]

=== b | 8f8e | 5d ===
Did you pick a school to 
join? [BRK]

Maybe you can give me a
tip on one...i'm lost
in this place![END]

=== c | 9002 | 4e ===
Whoa! You guys won the
competition, didn't you?[BRK]

Please, let me join your
dojo![END]

=== d | 905e | 30 ===
[POR10]
I'm sorry, but i don't train
people to fight![END]

=== e | 90aa | 61 ===
Come on! I promise i'll go
to practice everyday.[BRK]

Please, please, pleeeaaase.[BRK]

[POR10]
No, noo, nooooo!![END]

=== f | 911e | 110 ===
Oh master, have you returned
to your humble student?[BRK]

[POR10]
Listen you little annoyance,
there's no chance in hell
that i'm going to teach you.[BRK]

[POR00]
But you don't have to teach
me in hell. You can teach me
any place you want.[BRK]

[POR10]
Fine. Your first lesson is 
to face that corner.
[END]

=== 10 | 9242 | 52 ===
I'm sorry, but i thought
you forgot about me![BRK]

I just went and joined
another dojo.[END]

=== 11 | 92a4 | 78 ===
I'm going to start my own 
dojo.[BRK]

Do you know what kind of 
money they give to new
business owners?[BRK]

I'm going to be rich![END]

=== 12 | 9338 | e7 ===
I saw you in the competition
and you were great. What
dojo do you attend?[BRK]

[POR10]
...i don't endorse any
dojo.[BRK]

[POR00]
Well, maybe we could go 
into business together...[BRK]

I'll give you forty-percent
of the business. [BRK]

[POR10]
Sorry, not interested.[END]

=== 13 | 943e | 43 ===
I'm going to meet with the
bank today and get the
loan for my dojo.[END]

=== 14 | 9498 | 99 ===
Geez, i thought i would 
never get out of the bank.[BRK]

I spent over three hours 
signing papers![BRK]

I was just waiting for them
to ask me for a urine
specimen![END]

=== 15 | 9540 | 9d ===
I'm not going to open up
no dojo![BRK]

They don't give you enough
money to spit at...[BRK]

I've found more money on the
streets than what they were
going to give me...[END]

=== 16 | 95ea | 5b ===
[POR10]
One never makes money 
teaching...[BRK]

Their only reward is 
imparting knowledge to 
others.[END]

=== 17 | 9658 | 10a ===
I only came here to find
a good, strong man.[BRK]

I just like walking into
these dojos and watching
these studs work out.[BRK]

The constant bending over 
and stretching...oh man![BRK]

I just don't know which
man is the best...[BRK]

[POR05]
You're looking at the best
man in this town, honey![END]

=== 18 | 977a | 8e ===
I'm thinking about joining
one of these dojos, so i can
be closer to the men.[BRK]

[POR05]
Care to join ronfar's huggy,
touchy-feely dojo, sugar-
cakes?[END]

=== 19 | 9824 | b0 ===
I'm going to marry whoever
wins the competition.[BRK]

Then i'm sure i'll get the
toughest man here...[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm not interested in 
getting hitched, so you'll
have to find someone else.[END]

=== 1a | 98f4 | 79 ===
I can't believe you won the
competition. You're the
only one for me, jean![BRK]

[POR10]
I don't think so!
I'm a woman...not a man! [END]

=== 1b | 9984 | 71 ===
Sorry about the comment
i made when you came here
last time.[BRK]

I guess the emotion of you
winning just overcame me.[END]

=== 1c | 9a08 | 62 ===
Say jean, do you have a
brother, or maybe a dad?[BRK]

[POR10]
No!! And if i did, i 
wouldn't let you know!!
[END]

=== 1d | 9a7e | 66 ===
Jean, please see if you
can find someone for me
to marry.[BRK]

I just don't think i'll
ever find someone...[END]

=== 1e | 9af4 | 55 ===
I have no idea why i was
kicked out of the fat boy
dojo![BRK]

I was the biggest pig there![END]

=== 1f | 9b56 | a2 ===
You know, those fat jerks
are prejudiced![BRK]

They have no right even
calling it the fat boy dojo![BRK]

All of them look like twiggy
compared to me![BRK]

I think i'm gonna sue![END]

=== 20 | 9c08 | 4f ===
I'm thinking of starting my
own dojo.[BRK]

I think i'll call it the
porky boar dojo![END]

=== 21 | 9c6a | 4c ===
Tell me, do you think i'm
to blame?
[0x5]Of course you are!
I don't have a clue.[END]

=== 22 | 9cc6 | 99 ===
Liar! I was nowhere near
the bunny karate dojo.[BRK]

There's no proof that I
was in the showers taking
pictures....none![BRK]

Say, you're not the
coppers, are you?[END]

=== 23 | 9d74 | b6 ===
Good! Well, i just heard 
that some guy, probably
whacked-out of his mind,[BRK]

snuck into the bunny karate
dojo and took some pictures
of its members.[BRK]

That guy must really be 
a pervert![END]

=== 24 | 9e3e | 72 ===
They won't let me join the
bunny karate dojo.[BRK]

I think i'm going to file
a lawsuit. This is reverse
discrimination![END]

=== 25 | 9ec8 | 113 ===
I'm in! I'm in the bunny
karate dojo![BRK]

I just loooove these 
costumes![BRK]

Look at these cute little
ears, this fuzzy tail,[BRK]

and look what it does for 
my chest! [BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro, remember grandpa gwyn
said to run like hell if you
ever saw one of these guys![BRK]

What are you waiting for?[BRK]

Run![END]

=== 26 | 9ff6 | 3e ===
I just looove what this
costume does for my
figure, don't you?[END]

=== 27 | a048 | 15f ===
You know, i just looove your
costume, hiro.[BRK]

The cape! Whoo![BRK]

It just says 'i'm going to
come and bite your neck,
baby!'[BRK]

And then the boomerang! Oh
yeah, you know i'll be
coming back to you, big boy.[BRK]

Your costume gets one twirl,
a lick, a grab, a grope, and
two snaps in the air.[BRK]

[POR02]
...please, hiro! Let me fry
this guy's face off! Please?[BRK]

[POR01]
...ruuuby![END]

=== 28 | a1be | 56 ===
Hey! You guys make great
fighters! Want to join
our club?[BRK]

You'll loooove our costumes.[END]

=== 29 | a228 | 7b ===

[POR02]
Hiro, this guy's eyes are
all glazed over...[BRK]

[POR00]

[POR02]
I think we oughtta come
back to this one later.[END]

=== 2a | a2ba | 39 ===

[POR02]
We should give his brain
more time to form![END]

=== 2b | a30e | bd ===
I am practicing how to
tune out the world...[BRK]

The images that i see 
are too frightening...[BRK]

There's too much crime, 
violence, and pain with
no end in sight.[BRK]

Tell me, when will it
ever end?![END]

=== 2c | a3ea | 56 ===
It's easy just to tune
out the world...[BRK]

Someday it'll get better...
i hope.[BRK]

I wonder if he'll learn...[BRK]

That you'll never make a
difference if you just sit
around and do nothing.[END]

=== 2f | a500 | f5 ===
I'm looking for a strong
woman to marry...[BRK]

I've been to the bunny 
karate dojo, but they just
don't appeal to me...[BRK]

Say, you look like you're 
tough.[BRK]

Whaddaya say, sweetheart?[BRK]

[POR05]
Sorry. Not interested.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

And don't call me sweet-
heart.
[END]

=== 30 | a60c | 4a ===
You have come back to me,
my love. Time and distance
cannot stop our love![END]

=== 31 | a672 | 99 ===
Back so soon, honeychops?
I'm waiting to tempt your
tenderloins.[BRK]

[POR10]
What a letch![BRK]

Hiiiyyy-yaaaa![BRK]

That oughtta curb any
thinking that'll occur
down there.[END]

=== 32 | a72a | b6 ===
Jean, i'm sorry. I only
wanted a strong woman that
could stand up to...[BRK]

...uh, to my mother for me.[BRK]

[POR10]
If you can't take care of
your own mother, then you'll
never have a real woman![END]

=== 33 | a7f8 | 41 ===
I've been talking to my
mother about letting me
live on my own...[END]

=== 34 | a84c | da ===
Jean, i've talked it over
with my mother and she
said you can stay with us.[BRK]

Of course, you'll be staying
in my room, if ya get my
drift...<nudge> <nudge>.[BRK]

[POR10]
Why don't you come back and
talk to me when you get
a spine![END]

=== 35 | a93a | a0 ===
Jean, i love you!! Mother
loves you too...[BRK]

Please come and stay with
me...[BRK]

You can choose which side
of the bed you want to
sleep on...[BRK]

[POR02]
Is this guy for real?[END]

=== 36 | a9ee | 6e ===
All my life, i've sat here
thinking about the past...[BRK]

You know, i just don't know
how we survived this long...[END]

=== 37 | aa74 | 55 ===
I think we owe it all to
people like master lunn.[BRK]

They know how to take care
of us...[END]

=== 38 | aae0 | 97 ===
I've sat here thinking about
my life and i just don't
like what i see.[BRK]

I've got to get off my lazy
butt and do something about
this situation we're in.[END]

=== 39 | ab92 | 3d ===
I think that we will be
unable to weather the coming
storm...[END]

=== 3a | abde | 5c ===
You know, we just really 
don't take life that 
serious.[BRK]

And then when we do, it's
too late.[END]

=== 3b | ac48 | b4 ===
I've been thinking that the
end is really better than
the beginning.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm thinking that you need
a life.[BRK]

And i think you spend too
much time thinking instead
of doing something!
[END]

=== 3c | ad14 | 8b ===
I don't understand why lunn
was expelled for trying to
teach his karate...[BRK]

[POR10]
The karate that he was
teaching has no place in
this world...[END]

=== 3d | adb6 | 4c ===
I'm on lunn's side. We 
don't need to learn this
sissy karate that you like.[END]

=== 3e | ae1a | 80 ===
All right, either you
restore lunn to his place
or...[BRK]

Or...i'll do something 
really awful to you.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I'm not kidding...[END]

=== 3f | aeb6 | 30 ===
We want lunn![BRK]

Not no karate dunce![BRK]

We want lunn![END]

=== 40 | aefe | 70 ===
Say, if you're not going
to let lunn come back and
beat you...[BRK]

Then i guess i'll just have
to kick your butts...[END]

=== 41 | af7c | 45 ===
[POR10]
Hey pal, don't let your 
mouth write a check your
fist can't cash![END]

=== 42 | afdc | 28 ===
Master lunn....
what's happened to you??[END]

=== 43 | b018 | 65 ===
I just can't accept that
a wimp like you can beat
someone like lunn.[BRK]

He was the strongest man
i knew.[END]

=== 44 | b08a | 41 ===
[POR10]
Real strength comes from 
conditioning the heart and
the mind.[END]

=== 45 | b0e2 | 5c ===
Hey, haven't you caused
enough problems around
here![BRK]

I hate you so much. Just
beat it, okay?[END]

=== 46 | b152 | 9b ===
Master lunn is one of the
four heroes of althena...[BRK]

Some say he's the toughest
one of them.[BRK]

I just think he's so 
dreamy...[BRK]

[POR02]
I think i'm going to
puke...[END]

=== 47 | b204 | 5f ===
Some say i'm too infatuated
with lunn...[BRK]

I think they're all jealous
of what lunn and i have...[END]

=== 48 | b27a | 77 ===
Lunn has stopped answering
my letters...[BRK]

If i find out that he's 
going out with another 
woman,[BRK]

i'm going to kill him![END]

=== 49 | b30c | 92 ===
I just got out of the 
slammer. They say i've 
been stalking lunn...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Oh, i've got to go. Lunn
usually has his morning 
tea about now...[END]

=== 4a | b3ae | ac ===
I'm going to rip out your
spleen...[BRK]

I'm going to eat it with
some fifa beans and a nice
bottle of chianti...[BRK]

Then maybe you'll think
twice about what you've
done to lunn...[END]

=== 4b | b46e | 94 ===
This wall was built to
keep people out of horam.[BRK]

We don't have time to wage
war with anybody.[BRK]

We're too busy practicing
karate to fight with anyone.[END]

=== 4c | b51a | 4e ===
Hey! Step out of my light!
I have to finish shadow
boxing before the sun sets![END]

=== 4d | b580 | 4b ===
Can you hear me?[BRK]

Good, just checking.[BRK]

Can you see me? [BRK]

Good, just checking.[END]

=== 4e | b5e6 | 7a ===
This wall was built a very
long time ago...[BRK]

I'm glad, too! I don't think
i'd have the energy to build
something like this.[END]

=== 4f | b670 | 8e ===
Lunn was seeking only to
promote himself and his
new karate...[BRK]

I wonder if he'll be able
to go back and discover 
what karate is really about.[END]

=== 50 | b70c | 15 ===
[POR10]
I think he will...[END]

=== 51 | b734 | bd ===
I've heard that this god
'zophar' is going to be
revived from the dead.[BRK]

I'd pay good money to see
something like that.[BRK]

[POR08]
You poor soul. You don't
know what zophar will do 
to this place...[END]

Look! The lights! They're
fading...[BRK]

Don't you just love a good
eclipse?![END]

=== 53 | b868 | 9c ===
I've been practicing so
hard that i haven't even
seen my wife and kids.[BRK]

I wonder if they still
remember me?[BRK]

Oh well. Karate is more
important than they are.[END]

=== 54 | b912 | 23 ===
[POR10]
I think you need new
priorities.[END]

=== 55 | b942 | 50 ===
[POR07]
Say, mister, i'll find you
a family - for a small fee![BRK]

[POR02]
Have you no shame?![END]

=== 56 | b9ae | 3b ===
Jean, do you think you
could come and teach me
your karate?[END]

=== 57 | b9fc | 25 ===
Jean has become famous
here in horam![END]

=== 58 | ba34 | 77 ===
Jean, did you come back
here to open up a dojo
to teach us karate?[BRK]

[POR10]
Nope, sorry!! I want to get
back to the carnival![END]

=== 59 | baba | 95 ===
Hey, i'm going to win the
competition this year![BRK]

What are you laughing at!?[BRK]

After i kick lunn's butt,
i'm going to come and pay
you a little visit...[END]

Today has been a great
day! I almost broke a
piece of wood...[BRK]

Well...no...not with my
hand. But i almost chopped
it in two with this axe!
[END]

=== 5b | bc0c | 6b ===
I'm getting stronger each

I've rented all the 'rocky' 
movies and i think i'm 
going to win![END]

Why do you keep disturbing
my training?[BRK]

If i don't get in my full
two hours of training i'll
never be able to win![END]

=== 5d | bd1c | c5 ===
I've started training up
to four hours everyday.[BRK]

Well, it's not a true four
hours, 'cause i take a break
every twenty minutes...[BRK]

But at least i'm working
out, which is more than I
can say for you!
[END]

=== 5e | bdf4 | b6 ===
This is the best place to
train in the world![BRK]

I've been peeking into the
bunny dojo, and man! Am i 
telling you....[BRK]

It's well worth getting your

a glimpse![END]

=== 5f | bebe | eb ===
I can't believe that the
blue dragon cult was 
kidnapping children...[BRK]

I wonder how something like
that could happen...[BRK]

[POR10]
I think that children are
always easy targets...[BRK]

These people don't have the
guts to try and do this to
adults...[END]

=== 60 | bfbc | 63 ===
I wonder what's with all the
hype surrounding this karate
tournament?[BRK]

I mean, geez! Enough
already![END]

=== 61 | c036 | 53 ===
I wonder why these men
come to fight...[BRK]

Does anything good ever come
from violence?[END]

=== 62 | c0a0 | 83 ===
Please, tell me when this
competition gets over. I'm
tired of all the fighting.[BRK]

I hope that the strongest 
man wins the tournament![END]

=== 63 | c13e | 63 ===
I think master lunn has
been acting strange lately.[BRK]

I hope everything is going
all right for him...[END]

=== 64 | c1b8 | c4 ===
I've been searching for 
someone to call my own.[BRK]

I want someone that knows
how to take care of a woman.[BRK]

Ya know...tender, nurturing, 
and all that mushy stuff.[BRK]

He's gotta be out there
somewhere...[END]

=== 65 | c298 | 24 ===
Lunn was what?[BRK]

I don't believe it...[END]

=== 66 | c2cc | 72 ===
Lunn has completely changed
since he was defeated in
the tournament.[BRK]

I think he's become a
kinder, gentler lunn...[END]

=== 67 | c352 | 90 ===
I wanna be like master lunn
and just beat the crap out
of people.[BRK]

And then they'll all come
to me for training, and i'll
charge them mega-bucks.[END]

=== 68 | c3fa | 8e ===
Of course, one day i'll 
have to fight lunn.[BRK]

But that doesn't mean I
have to fight fairly.[BRK]

I'm going to go buy me some
spiked brass knuckles!
[END]

=== 69 | c4a0 | 83 ===
Once i'm the most feared
man in all the world,[BRK]

i'll fight fair. But i'll
never give up my iron
codpiece...[BRK]

Ya know...just in case.
[END]

=== 6a | c53e | 71 ===
Lunn was such a joke! I 
could've beaten him in
my sleep.[BRK]

I wonder who the next
high-profile humiliation
will be?[END]

[POR10]
Get used to famous people
letting you down. It happens
all the time![BRK]

Usually on sunset...
[END]

=== 6c | c628 | 69 ===
I've heard that lunn is 
teaching a new kind of
karate.[BRK]

Yesss! I've still got a 
chance to kick his butt![END]

Horam[END]

Who are you?[BRK]

Why are you bothering me?[BRK]

Don't you know there's a
martial arts tournament
to prepare for?[BRK]

...lunn? You're looking for
lunn? There's no one here
by that name.[BRK]

Go ask wong-lee in the back
room if he knows anyone by
that name.[BRK]

You might get lucky. Now
leave me alone![END]

=== 6f | f6b8 | b6 ===
Didn't i say that i don't
know anybody named lunn?[BRK]

I also said to ask the old
wise man wong-lee if he
might know. [BRK]

Were those instructions too
difficult? Do you have
mental problems?[END]

=== 70 | f786 | 9b ===
Shee! What a transformation!
I would have never guessed
you were a fighter![BRK]

So you've come to fight in
the tournament, have you?
Good luck...frog licker!

[END]

The dancer takes a self-

she's a karate whiz...[BRK]

That's the best joke i've

[POR10]
We'll see who the joke's
on when i finish the
tournament, pinhead.[END]

=== 72 | f8f8 | 54 ===
I'm tellin' you. This

I can't believe that you
beat lunn! Your skill is
quite impressive.[BRK]

to hold a grudge about
b-before...are you?[BRK]

I-i'm all for the equal
rights thing...see....
i even know the chant![BRK]

Equal rights![BRK]

Well, just goes to show

I've heard that you may
know where lunn is.[BRK]

Please, sensei, i must find
lunn and gain entry into
the tournament.[BRK]

[POR00]
I've not seen clothes like
yours before. What
discipline did you study?[BRK]

[POR10]
Blue dragon karate, sensei.
My knowledge comes from a
master of long ago.[BRK]

[POR00]
Hmmm...why do you want to
enter the tournament? Fame?
Fortune?...revenge?[BRK]

[POR10]
No. I tried once to deny the
power instilled in me by
my master.[BRK]

But now i can escape my
destiny no longer. I must
fight to know...[BRK]

The time has come for me to
own up to my past. It's the
only way...[BRK]

[POR02]
Um, excuse me? What is she
talking about?

[POR10]
My new skill combines the
power of blue dragon karate
and the grace of dance.[BRK]

[POR00]
Mmmm...i sense that all
doubt has been cleared from
your mind, grasshopper.[BRK]

Remember, you must control
your power in confidence,
never in fear.[BRK]

If you are fearful of your
power, you will die a fool's
death.[BRK]

Lunn is powerful, but he has
also forgotten the true
meaning of karate.[BRK]

I sense that you will show
him that power comes in
many forms.[BRK]

[POR10]
I understand, sensei. I am
ready to take my place.[BRK]

[POR00]
Ah, yes, little one. The
tournament. Here...take
this.[BRK]

You cannot enter the
tournament without it.[BRK]

[0xB][0][0x5]Received the invitation.[END]

=== 78 | 10148 | d5 ===
The tournament takes place
in the hidden city to the
southeast of horam.[BRK]

If you have trouble finding
it, i will send a guide with
you, grasshopper.[BRK]

[POR10]
Thank you, sensei. I know
the way.[BRK]

It was my home, long ago...[END]

=== 79 | 10220 | 8f ===
I am counting on you, little
one.[BRK]

Lunn's misuse of power is a
disgrace to his teacher's
dojo...[BRK]

You must show him the true
meaning of karate...[END]

=== 7a | 102ca | 4d ===
Remember, grasshopper. The
tournament is in the secret
city to the southeast.[END]

=== 7b | 10346 | 11c ===
Ohh?! Lunn said all that?[BRK]

You have served your purpose
well, grasshopper.[BRK]

Now my dojo can have the
shame of lunn's misuse of
power lifted from it.[BRK]

....yes, i am the master
who taught lunn, before
he became drunk with power.[BRK]

Thank you for showing him
the light, and restoring my
honor.[END]

=== 7c | 1047e | d4 ===
I will be satisfied only
when lunn learns that karate
should flow through us all.[BRK]

It is not to be misused to
force one's will on others.[BRK]

You have gone a long way
toward teaching him that, 
grasshopper. Thank you.[END]

=== 7d | 10566 | 71 ===
Say, are you not companions

She is not here. She spoke

Perhaps she is there.[END]

Ah, young jean. I see that
you have returned to finish
your training.[BRK]

The martial arts are never
fully mastered, but i will
help you learn more...[BRK]

[POR10]
Sorry, sensei. I am only
helping my friend here.[BRK]

When this is over, i will
return to being merely a
dancer.[END]

=== 7f | 10702 | c7 ===
Ahhh grasshopper, you are
wasting your time on this...

Stay here with me. I can

you never dreamed possible![BRK]

You know...i wrote the kama-

=== 80 | 107dc | c4 ===
I heard that wong-lee was
behind the secret tournament
that has been called.[BRK]

He called it to find someone
who is strong enough to beat
lunn.[BRK]

Wong-lee was his master, but
now he fears lunn's power.[END]

=== 81 | 108b8 | 83 ===
Oh, are you looking for
the wight dojo?[BRK]

No, i'm sorry, you've got
the wong dojo.[BRK]

The wight dojo has been
closed for many years now.[END]

=== 82 | 10956 | 60 ===
What? That girl named jean
beat lunn? I can't believe
it...[BRK]

She didn't seem to be that
powerful.[END]

=== 83 | 109d6 | 68 ===
Regardless how you did
it, jean, i must give you
my sincerest thanks![BRK]

Lunn deserved everything he
got.

The younger generation is

Even though i have trained

Whoa! I dig the symbolism,

This is the storehouse

In horam, there are two

and dojos of weapon combat.
Any student can enter the
tournament.[END]

Ahh! Have you come to
examine our wares?[BRK]

You know, there are many
dojos in horam.[BRK]

Some are for weapons combat,
and some are for hand-to-
hand combat.[BRK]

Any student of the dojos in
horam can enter the
tournament.[END]

=== 88 | 10d32 | 50 ===
It's almost like a dream!
I can't believe you beat
lunn![BRK]

Thank you, one and all![END]

=== 89 | 10d9e | 6f ===
I just can't thank you guys
enough for showing that
brute lunn his place![BRK]

Just know that i'll never
forget you![END]

=== 8a | 10e1c | 56 ===
I heard that the power
locked within the heart of
a boy saved our world![BRK]

Is that true?[END]

=== 8b | 10e86 | be ===
Wong-lee over there is the
master of this dojo, and
leader of horam.[BRK]

He is also the one who
taught lunn everything he
knows.[BRK]

Wong-lee has announced a
tournament to gauge lunn's
true power...[END]

=== 8c | 10f5c | 10e ===
Lunn doesn't follow the
teachings of his master any
more.[BRK]

He now says that karate is
best used as a tool of
assassination.[BRK]

And that using karate as a
defensive tool is proof of
one's weak mind.[BRK]

The only way to beat lunn
is by using karate, but no
one is strong enough...[END]

=== 8d | 11086 | b5 ===
Lunn insists that karate is
meant to be used as a tool
to further selfish desire.[BRK]

He claims that only the weak
cannot see this.[BRK]

I think he's nuts.[BRK]

Bonkers.[BRK]

Cuckoo for cocoa puffs...[END]

=== 8e | 1115a | e1 ===
Are you the girl that knows
blue dragon karate?[BRK]

You are probably the only
one that stands a chance
against lunn.[BRK]

Your heart is pure, and your
skills refined.[BRK]

If you show him your way,
maybe he will return from
working evil...[END]

=== 8f | 1125a | 7a ===
The secret town where the
tournament takes place is
southeast from here.[BRK]

You have the skill. I pray
you also possess luck.[END]

=== 90 | 112f0 | 9e ===
If we serve our land with
purity of heart and
purpose,[BRK]

our land will prosper and
anything becomes possible![BRK]

Maybe now lunn understands
this...thank you, jean.[END]

=== 91 | 113ae | 26 ===
My gratitude to you is
beyond words...[END]

=== 92 | 113ec | 79 ===
Say, if the althena cult was
using lunn, knowing his
heart was bad,[BRK]

why did they do it? It...
...it doesn't make sense...[END]

=== 93 | 11474 | 4f ===
Thanks to you, lunn has seen
the error of his ways and is
working for good now.[END]

=== 94 | 114d0 | 48 ===
Jean, if you hadn't come, I
don't know what would have
happened to us...[END]

=== 95 | 1152c | 76 ===
The students of this dojo
have been losing to lunn
for months now...[BRK]

It seems that we are no
match for his evil power.[END]

=== 96 | 115ba | 74 ===
Lunn was once a pupil of
wong-lee.[BRK]

Because of that, he knows
all the secrets of our
karate.[BRK]

We are no match for him.[END]

=== 97 | 11642 | 8c ===
You are entering the special
tournament? Are you sure you
want to fight lunn?[BRK]

He's very strong...battles
with him seem to last only
seconds![END]

=== 98 | 116e6 | c0 ===
I'm very impressed! I heard
that you beat lunn.[BRK]

What have you been eating?
It seems to have made you
very strong![BRK]

I'd like to say wheaties,
but i'm embarrassed to say
it's...[BRK]

...spam.





[END]

=== 99 | 117c2 | 43 ===
I guess it took one master
of blue dragon karate to
beat another...[END]

=== 9a | 11814 | 12e ===
Say, i heard that you used
a secret blue dragon karate
technique to beat lunn![BRK]

It's the one where you copy
every move your opponent
makes,[BRK]

as well as everything they
say.[BRK]

It both confuses and annoys
the hell out of them in one
easy step...pure genius![BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, i don't think you got
that exactly right...[END]

=== 9b | 11956 | cb ===
Lunn taught me the way of
blue dragon karate before
he went awry.[BRK]

Everyone in the dojo used
to want to be as good a
pupil as he was.[BRK]

But now we spit on the
ground he walked on! He has
betrayed us all...
[END]

=== 9c | 11a38 | 3a ===
I can't believe that lunn
used to be my idol![BRK]

Never again![END]

=== 9d | 11a8e | aa ===
I'm glad you were able to 
defeat lunn. Maybe now
he'll get a clue...[BRK]

His way was not benefiting
anyone but himself![BRK]

We must all use karate to
work for the common good...[END]

I'm sure i speak for every
student of this dojo when
i say 'thanks!'[END]

Lunn was born with a gift
for learning the martial
arts.[BRK]

Now he will learn them
once again from the start
in the great hall...[END]

=== a0 | 11c3a | b5 ===
The karate that lunn has
perfected is purely evil.[BRK]

I can't believe that wong-
lee has invited him to the
tournament![BRK]

I'm certain there will be
trouble of some sort. Mark
my words...[END]

=== a1 | 11d06 | 6e ===
There is no one i know of
that can stand against
lunn's skill![BRK]

His blue dragon karate is
too strong, too evil![END]

It seems that wong-lee had
faith in your ability. I'm
sorry i did not.[BRK]

I will go behind the
building and practice self-
flagellation for my error. [BRK]

But won't you go blind if
you do that?

Lunn is an example to all
of us in the dojo.[BRK]

If he went bad, anyone can.[END]
