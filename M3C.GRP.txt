Hiro...you should not have
come.[BRK]

You can't possibly win
against zophar...[BRK]

He has bound my power, and
the power of althena stands
ready for him to take.[BRK]

We must face the fact that
our chance to stop him
slipped by...[BRK]

...and there is no way to
get it back...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Unless....[BRK]

Perhaps althena was right
and the power of humanity
can overcome him.[BRK]

...i cannot believe that
it is so, but it is the
only hope left![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

You must try...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Here...this is the only
assistance i can offer.[BRK]

Take it...

Lucia, you must believe in
us![BRK]

The power of humanity is the
key to defeating zophar,
just as althena said.[BRK]

It's stronger than any magic
ever devised...[BRK]

If you only believe...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I'm coming for you, lucia!
Don't give up![END]
