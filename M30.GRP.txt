In fact, right now the Guild
membership is just being
expanded.[BRK]

If you join right now,
you'll be charter members![BRK]

And you'll also become part
of the rich history and 
tradition of Vane.[BRK]

So, what do you think? Do
you want to join the Magic
Guild?[BRK]

[POR02]
It sounds really nice, but
we're really in a hurry. We
have a quest to finish...[BRK]

[POR07]
Oh, don't say that! At least
say you'll think about it.[BRK]

Please! Please! Please![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR07]
Well then, if you finish
this quest faster, you can
join the Guild![BRK]

So, I'll tell you what: I'll
go with you to speed up this
little quest of yours.[BRK]

I'm sure you can use an
extra hand, especially one
skilled in magic![BRK]

[POR02]
B-B...But we didn't ask you
to...[BRK]

[POR07]
Oh pooh! Just shush up and
let's get moving![END]

[POR07]
I hope that once we finish
your quest, you'll join the
Guild.[BRK]

I'll do my best to speed
things along. Just think
about it, okay?[BRK]

[POR02]
Don't you think you're being
a little...er...pushy?[BRK]

[POR08]
This Magic Guild sounds
quite enchanting...[BRK]

[POR02]
Watch it, Lucia. This girl
sounds desperate. If you say
any more,[BRK]

you'll probably find
yourself hog-tied and being
dragged to this magic city.[BRK]

[POR05]
Oh, c'mon, Ruby! She's not
that bad! And besides, we
could use her in battle![BRK]

[POR10]
Okay, Ronfar! That's enough!
She's off-limits to you![BRK]

[POR05]
Hey! I wasn't thinking
anything but pure thoughts![BRK]

[POR02]
Pure what? Lust? [BRK]

[POR07]
Are we gonna talk or are we
gonna move? Time's slipping
by! Let's go![END]

[POR02]
Whoooo! I'm getting the
creepy feeling we're not
alone in here...[END]

=== 4 | 14a0a | 80 ===
           BANG![BRK]

[POR02]
W-What was that?[BRK]

[POR05]
It sounded like a door
slamming open or shut.[BRK]

[POR02]
D-Do you think it was a
...a...ghost?[END]

=== 5 | 14aa6 | 90 ===
           BANG![BRK]

[POR02]
There it is again! Now that
I think about it, it's
probably not a ghost...[BRK]

They wouldn't be using a
door...W-Would they?[END]

=== 6 | 14b56 | 101 ===
Whooooo hooo hooo hoo! Wind
shriek sharply to pass my
test...[BRK]

...Shriek.....sharply...![BRK]

[POR02]
That...sounded...like...a
...g-g...ghost![BRK]

[POR00]
Wind...wind...wind! Mark
and remember......Whoooooo![BRK]

[POR02]
W...W-W-What is he talking
about? L-Let's get out of
here![END]

=== 7 | 14c7e | ac ===
Wind...wind...wind! Send
forth your power...[BRK]

[POR02]
I-I...wish that ghost would
stop that! What is it
talking about?[BRK]

And why is it talking to
us?!! I'm completely creeped
out![END]

=== 8 | 14d4e | 9d ===
Close the shutters and open
the door to opportunity...
...Whoooooo![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR05]
Shutters? What shutters?[BRK]

Hello?!! For a ghost, you
sure are vague! Geez![END]

=== 9 | 14e16 | bc ===
Make dark the window of
the soul to create your
opportunity...[BRK]

[POR05]
There it is again! What the
heck is that creepy thing
getting at??[BRK]

Wait...hmm...Window of the
soul...Doesn't that mean...?[END]

=== a | 14ef6 | 75 ===
Dancer...Dancer, light on
your feet...You hold the
key to salvation...[BRK]

[POR10]
Feet? Salvation? It doesn't
make any sense![END]

=== b | 14f96 | 8a ===
All will be revealed if you
search out your heart.[BRK]

The key unique lies within
your soul...Find it![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't taunt us! Tell us the
answer![END]
