Red priest mauri is not
prepared for the next...[BRK]

Ma...mar...mauri...
n...no...no...ahhhh!![BRK]

I'm sorry, did i just
black out? That keeps
happening.[BRK]

It's very annoying.[BRK]

Anyway, as i was saying,[BRK]

mauri is not prepared for
the next group of candidates
for the cleansing.[BRK]

Please wait.
[END]

=== 1 | 1a524 | 8f ===
I...don't remember what...[BRK]

How did i get here?[BRK]

The last thing i remember 
was mauri cleansing me...[BRK]

After that...it's all just
a black fog...

What!? Look! I've drooled
all over my clothes![BRK]

This is just great! Now
i look like a complete
dork![BRK]

...man! I wonder how I
managed to drool like this
and not know it!!!?[END]

=== 4 | 1a738 | b6 ===
Zophar, i am prepared to
die in your honorable
service![BRK]

Bbbyyyeett...blaaaahh!
Aaahhh...hahahahahaha![BRK]

[POR08]
Zophar is brainwashing these
people. If we don't hurry,
they'll go insane...
[END]

=== 5 | 1a802 | 183 ===
How...how did i get here?[BRK]

I never would have come here
of my own accord. This place
is too creepy![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Oh, i get it! This is some
kinda weirdo birthday gag![BRK]

All right! Ya got me! You
can all come out now![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

It...was a...gag...wasn't
it?[BRK]

[POR02]
I really don't know how
we're gonna break the truth
to this guy...[BRK]

So let's just split and let
him figure it out for
himself, okay?[END]

=== 6 | 1a998 | 8a ===
I...must kill althena...[BRK]


....once she is gone...[BRK]



...zophar will return...[BRK]

Our blood must be shed in
the service of great master
zophar![END]

=== 7 | 1aa3a | 77 ===
Only the goddess stands in
zophar's way...[BRK]

She must...be...eliminated.[BRK]

Zophar, help me to make this
dream my reality!

[END]

=== 8 | 1aac4 | 12a ===
I can't believe the crazy
nonsense i was saying in
this place![BRK]

I mean, read some of this
drivel i was writing![BRK]

We're talking completely
insane, here![BRK]

You've got to stop zophar
before he uses this black
power on everyone![BRK]

If you fail, we're going
to be nothing but fertilizer
for zophar's new world.[END]

=== 9 | 1ac02 | 66 ===
I've...been...blacking...
....out...[BRK]

I...don't know who i am...
must...do...the will...
of...zophar...[END]

=== a | 1ac80 | 67 ===
Another day has passed 
without our master![BRK]

Why does he hold us in
suspense? Come to us now,
my liege!![END]

=== b | 1acfa | 55 ===
I can't believe the things
i've done in this place...[BRK]

I've got to get out of 
here...[END]

=== c | 1ad5e | 83 ===
I...must...help...zophar![BRK]

Soon, the dark master will
return to...relieve all of
these miserable...souls...[BRK]

Aaahhh...hahahahahahaha![END]

=== d | 1adf4 | 304 ===
Look! Outside it's so 
peaceful...[BRK]

When i was in this place, I
thought the world was coming
to an end.[BRK]

But now that my eyes have
been opened, i see that it
was all just a dream...[BRK]

A really, really bad dream.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

One that will probably shape
my entire life from this
point onward.[BRK]

In fact, i bet it changes
the lives of everyone around
me, too.[BRK]

I bet i'll have to go into
therapy, and i won't be able
to pay my bills.[BRK]

I'll become a social outcast
consumed by madness.[BRK]

Night will become a terrible
visitor, bringing back this
ordeal in my dreams.[BRK]

Now that i think about it,
my life will probably be
ruined.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Or, maybe not. I got over
the ordeal with my mother-
in-law.[BRK]

Zophar's a pussycat compared
to that rag.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I guess i'll get over this,
too...
[END]

=== e | 1b10c | a7 ===
I will kill all those that
oppose you, lord zophar![BRK]

Your return will be an
unqualified success!![BRK]

I will give my life in order
for you to recreate this
miserable world![END]

=== f | 1b1ca | 54 ===
I'm prepared to kill for 
the dark master.[BRK]

Zophar, please. Let me do
your bidding...[END]

When i look back on the last
few days...[BRK]

All i can say is...[BRK]

Was i nuts, or what?[END]

[POR09]
...mauri![BRK]

The time has come to settle
this![BRK]

[POR15]
...why do you come to me
with condemnation in your
eyes?[BRK]

I don't understand why i'm
in this horrific place![BRK]

Help me, leo![BRK]

[POR09]
Your evil guile will not
fool me this time, sister![BRK]

If i cannot break you free
from the spell which binds
you,[BRK]

i'm prepared to kill you
to save this world![BRK]

[POR05]
No!!! Leo, wait![END]

=== 13 | 1c51a | da ===
[POR09]
What?![BRK]

Ronfar, leave here this
instant.[BRK]

This battle is mine and
mine alone.[BRK]

One way or another, i will
free mauri from the control
of zophar.[BRK]

[POR05]
Leo, you don't have to kill
mauri! Zophar's essence has
disappeared!!
[END]

=== 14 | 1c610 | ae ===
[POR09]
...zophar's essence? Ronfar,
are you drunk again? [BRK]

[POR05]
Listen leo, i don't have
time to explain this to 
you right now.[BRK]

Let me go take care of
mauri.[BRK]

Be patient, my friend.[END]

=== 15 | 1c6d2 | 1ec ===
[POR15]
...ronfar! Oh, ronfar, I
knew you would come![BRK]

You got my letter, didn't
you?[BRK]

[POR05]
Now that lucia has dispelled
zophar's magic on this area,
you should be healed![BRK]

[POR15]
Oh, ronfar! I can't believe
i'm finally gazing into
your eyes![BRK]

Free from any affliction![BRK]

Please don't let this be
another cruel dream![BRK]

I don't know if i could
take it...[BRK]

[POR05]
It's no dream, mauri.
I'm here.[BRK]

[POR15]
It...it's just so hard to
believe that zophar's power
disappeared so suddenly...[BRK]

I mean...it was so...so
very strong!
[END]

=== 16 | 1c8c8 | 424 ===
[POR05]
What?!![BRK]

What was that flash?[BRK]

What's happening to mauri?![BRK]

[POR08]
Oh no! I was afraid this
might happen...[BRK]

I believe that mauri was
under zophar's influence for
too long.[BRK]

The essence of zophar's
power still has some kind
of hold on her soul.[BRK]

It's trying to claim her
mind and heart, once and
for all...[BRK]

If zophar's essence succeeds
in taking her over,[BRK]

she will remain a vessel
of zophar's evil, forever.[BRK]

And then, neither i nor the
goddess althena can do
anything to bring her back.[BRK]

[POR05]
I can't just watch her slip
away like this, lucia...[BRK]

Please! I'll do anything to
save her...there must be a
way![BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

If you truly mean that,
ronfar, there might be one
way.[BRK]

But it may cost you your
life.[BRK]

[POR05]
Whatever it is...i'll do it![BRK]

[POR08]
To save her now, you must
enter her subconscious,[BRK]

and do battle against the
evil within her yourself.[BRK]

But if you fail, both your
lives will end.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

There is only a small amount
of althena's power left in
this,[BRK]

but it should be adequate...[BRK]

[POR05]
Lay it on me! Zophar's evil
will be no match for me![BRK]

I will free you, mauri!

[END]

=== 17 | 1ccf6 | 107 ===
[POR05]
C'mon, lucia! Zap me,
before it's too late![BRK]

[POR08]
...are you sure that you 
want to risk your life just
to save her?[BRK]

Once i use this power, there
can be no turning back...[BRK]

[POR05]
Mauri is the only person
that i've ever loved![BRK]

I have to do this! C'mon,
lucia...hit me![END]

=== 18 | 1ce18 | ee ===
[POR15]
That fool! Ronfar is doomed
to die a fool's death.[BRK]

...and you along with him![BRK]

Every wrong step he takes
within will call forth my
fire of judgment on you![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Hm, hm, hm, hm. Basically,
your dear ronfar will be
your executioner![END]

=== 19 | 1cf10 | 66 ===
[POR09]
Ronfar, i sure hope you
know what you're doing...[BRK]

...plan your course
carefully, or we're all
dead.[END]

=== 1a | 1cf92 | fc ===
[POR15]
Oh, ronfar...[BRK]

I'll wait for you at raculi
village!             [BRK]

Don't worry, you've saved 
me! I'm fine now...really![BRK]

Hurry and finish zophar![BRK]

[POR05]
I'll be back in your arms
in no time...[BRK]

[POR15]
You haven't changed one 
bit in all these years,
sugar lips![END]

=== 1b | 1d0ae | 1f9 ===
[POR15]
I'm so worried about leo.[BRK]

He looked so...desperate
when he left.[BRK]

Where has he gone?[BRK]

[POR05]
Mauri, don't worry about 
leo.[BRK]

He'll be fine, once he sorts
this part of his life out.[BRK]

All of our lives are in the
crapper because of zophar...[BRK]

And leo is realizing that
everything he's worked for
has actually helped zophar![BRK]

That's a mighty large
revelation for anyone.[BRK]

It'll take some time for him
to work this one out.[BRK]

But there's no doubt in my
mind that he'll come around.[BRK]

After all, he is the white
knight...

The door over there leads

You must find a way to
stop it before you can
proceed.[BRK]

Look around inside. There
must be a way...[BRK]

...ronfar!!![BRK]

Mauri...have you returned
to us, my dear sister?[BRK]

[POR15]
Yes...leo...ronfar saved
me.[BRK]

I'm just a little weak from 
the poison...[BRK]

[POR09]
Dear lord! I was within
seconds of killing you![BRK]

And there was a way to
bring you back, but I
couldn't see it...[BRK]

Can you ever forgive me?[BRK]

[POR15]
There is nothing to forgive.
If it wasn't for ronfar, I
would've killed you...[BRK]

[POR05]
...that's enough talk about
killing. We're all back, and 
that's what's important.[BRK]

[POR02]
It looks like ronfar and 
mauri are finally going to
get together...[BRK]

Kinda tugs at the old heart
strings, doesn't it?[BRK]

Go ahead ronfar, kiss her. [BRK]

We won't look![BRK]

[POR05]
...blasted cat!![BRK]

Don't you have anything 
better to do than play
matchmaker?[BRK]

[POR15]
Ha, ha, ha...[END]

[POR05]
...hey...leo!!![BRK]

Where are you going?[BRK]

Don't you think it's time
you joined our fight?[BRK]

[POR09]
...my power is no longer 
of use to anyone...[BRK]

When you have restored the
red dragon, then the goddess
will be freed.[BRK]

Ronfar, you and your friends
are responsible for our
future. But i...i'm...[BRK]

[POR05]
Use? What purpose can tears
serve that could possibly
help us?[BRK]

[POR08]
You don't understand. These
tears contain a small
fraction of althena's power.[BRK]

But it should be enough to
free this area from zophar's
control.[BRK]

I will try to use them to
do just that.[BRK]

Hopefully, there is enough
power...
[END]

=== 25 | 1e4f8 | 15c ===
[POR08]
There.[BRK]

I sense zophar's presence
retreating from this place.[BRK]

But i don't know how long
we will be protected.[BRK]

We must find mauri and get
out of here immediately.[BRK]

[POR05]
Lucia, i won't forget what
you've done here.[BRK]

I will find some way to
repay you...bet on it![BRK]

We'd better find mauri
