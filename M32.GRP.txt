Donated 100s![END]

[POR09]
We must wait here for our
audience with the Goddess.
She will arrive shortly,[BRK]

but there's no way of
telling when she will see
us.[BRK]

[POR02]
...Well, in that case, I
think we should go sight-
seeing.[END]

=== 2 | 15e2c | 68 ===
[POR09]
I just received word that
the Goddess is prepared for
your audience, Lucia.[BRK]

Shall I guide you inside?[END]

=== 3 | 15e98 | 24 ===
[0x5]No thank you!
Yes, please guide us.[END]

=== 4 | 15ecc | 163 ===
[POR01]
I think we can find the
Goddess ourselves. Thanks
anyway, Leo.[BRK]

[POR02]
Are you nuts, Hiro? Half the
time you can't find the way
outta your bedroom![BRK]

[POR08]
Don't worry, Ruby, I believe
that I can assist Hiro in
finding the Goddess.[BRK]

Besides, I would like to see
more of Pentagulia anyway.[BRK]

Once I've seen the Goddess,
I may not be able to come
back...[BRK]

[POR01]
...Lucia?[END]

=== 5 | 16040 | 132 ===
[POR01]
Leo, please take us to the
Goddess.[BRK]

Lucia, aren't you happy?
Your quest is nearly at an
end![BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

But if I do see...
...then Hiro and....
No! I must go...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

This is the moment I have
sought since I came to your
world.[BRK]

The time is upon us. Let's
go...[BRK]

[POR09]
Hiro, Lucia, please follow
me.[END]

=== 6 | 1617c | a4 ===
[POR09]
Goddess Althena, your humble
servant has returned from
afar.[BRK]

And I have brought Lucia
back with me.[BRK]

She wishes to speak with
you on a matter of great
importance.[END]

=== 7 | 1622a | 14e ===
[POR08]
...!?[BRK]

[POR14]
Hm, hm, hm......
...............My, my![BRK]

Seems that we have quite the
firebrand in our presence![BRK]

Your mother obviously never
taught you the benefit of
proper manners.[BRK]

Perhaps a little...er...
...creative redirection is
in order...[BRK]

Hold on, dear Lucia. I'm
afraid it's going to be a
bumpy ride...[BRK]

Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm...[END]

=== 8 | 16382 | e ===
[POR01]
...Lucia!![END]

=== 9 | 1639a | 2df ===
[POR18]
Ha ha ha ha! Excellent work,
Ghaleon![BRK]

Your superb work is an honor
to my name![BRK]

[POR14]
Hrmph! Perhaps soon you will
give me a challenge worthy
of my skill.[BRK]

These humans are about as
dangerous as raindrops.[BRK]

[POR09]
...Ghaleon! What...What
just happened?[BRK]

[POR18]
Ah, Leo! I am beginning to
question your motivation.[BRK]

This destroyer was clearly
brought here as an assassin.[BRK]

Perhaps you knew of her
intent?[BRK]

[POR09]
No...I...![BRK]

[POR14]
Perhaps our good Lord Leo
is a bit too...er...good
for his own welfare.[BRK]

Question is...where exactly
does his loyalty lie?[BRK]

[POR09]
....
.....[BRK]

How dare you question my
loyalty![BRK]

There is no one living that
can turn me away from
serving the Goddess![BRK]

Just wait...I will prove
my worth![BRK]

[POR14]
Hm, hm, hm, hm...Oh,
I can't wait to see this.[END]

=== a | 16696 | d7 ===
I've heard that you are
thinking about relocating
to Pentagulia soon.[BRK]

Perhaps we can get together
and discuss philosophy
sometime...[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, sorry...You heard wrong.
There's no way we're moving
to this creepy joint![END]

=== b | 16780 | 49 ===
Goddess Althena watches out
for all those that follow
her pure teachings.[END]

=== c | 167ce | b1 ===
Althena is saving her power
to ward off the destroyer.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

You know, I've heard that
Zophar is trying to revive
himself...[BRK]

If that's true, we're all
in for one wild ride![END]

=== d | 1688e | 6f ===
Only Ghaleon and Althena
are allowed to enter the
second floor sanctuary.[BRK]

That's the rule, love it
or leave it.[END]

=== e | 16910 | 67 ===
Leo, sir! Where are you
taking these people? This
area is off-limits.[BRK]

[POR09]
The Goddess has summoned
them.[END]

=== f | 16986 | 8c ===
Hey...you![BRK]

Where's Lord Leo?[BRK]

You shouldn't just walk 
around here unsupervised.[BRK]

You might have an......
accident...if you get
my meaning.[END]

=== 10 | 16a22 | 8a ===
The second floor of this
sanctuary is the most secret
place in Pentagulia.[BRK]

I'm dying to know what's up
there, but I'm afraid I
never will.[END]

=== 11 | 16ac0 | af ===
Leo, sir! Don't you know
that no one is allowed on
the second floor?[BRK]

[POR09]
Pah! What do you take me
for, a fool?!![BRK]

I am under direct orders
from the Goddess to bring
them to her.[END]

=== 12 | 16b7e | 3e ===
Leo left here rather
hastily.[BRK]

I wonder what's gotten
into him?[END]

=== 13 | 16bc2 | 12 ===
Pentagulia Shr. 1F[END]

=== 14 | 185de | 40e ===
[POR18]
How dare you say that I'm
not the Goddess Althena![BRK]

Do you not know that I
control the Four Dragons, 
the four heroes,[BRK]

and the Dragonmaster? I have
proven to all these people
that I'm Althena.[BRK]

I have youth and beauty.[BRK]

I am the Goddess![BRK]

[POR08]
Your actions are not those
of a true goddess!![BRK]

[POR18]
Ha ha ha, you fool! How do
know how a goddess is to
act?[BRK]

The fact that I stand before
you should be proof enough.[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

...I won't believe it![BRK]

[POR18]
Oh, but darling...you have
no choice![BRK]

And the time has come for
me to show you how truly
powerful I've become![BRK]

Even Ghaleon has been 
reborn to protect and to
serve the Goddess...[BRK]

[POR08]
Yes, but by whose authority?
Certainly not yours![BRK]

[POR14]
Oh, the little princess has
copped an attitude...How
endearing.[BRK]

[POR18]
Silence, Ghaleon! I can
handle this.[BRK]

...Well, Lucia.[BRK]

The time has come for you
to give of yourself for the
honor of Althena.[BRK]

Soon we will extract your
power, and I will finally
achieve eternal youth![BRK]

Unfortunately, your life
will also end.[BRK]

Enjoy this time, Lucia. It's
all you have left...[END]

=== 15 | 189f0 | 14d ===
[POR14]
It's so sad to see ones
consumed by their selfish
desires.[BRK]

Her desire has blinded her
to the truth of what's
really happening here.[BRK]

Lucia, soon everything we
know will change...[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

But...wasn't Zophar the
one that brought you back?[BRK]

I know that this fake
Althena did not,[BRK]

but I cannot think of a
reason why Zophar would![END]

=== 16 | 18b40 | 2f ===
[POR09]
Zophar's power!?
But that can't be true....[END]

=== 17 | 18b78 | ee ===
[POR09]
I can't believe that I've
been such a fool![BRK]

The cult is working to
revive Zophar, and I've
been helping![BRK]

But this doesn't make any
sense whatsoever![BRK]

I can't believe that all
we heard was true![BRK]

I've got to find a way
out of this mess![END]

=== 18 | 18c8a | 136 ===
[POR08]
Oh, Hiro...Thank you!
I knew you'd come![BRK]

All of you are such good
friends![BRK]

[POR01]
Lucia...[BRK]

[POR08]
Hiro, the Althena in this
sanctuary is a fake.[BRK]

We must find the real
Althena and put a stop
to this madness![BRK]

Every second we waste puts
more power in the hands of
Zophar![BRK]

Oh, this is terrible! I
don't know what to do![END]

Pentagulia Shr. 2F[END]

=== 1a | 1a422 | 259 ===
[POR08]
There must be some way to
sense Althena's presence...[BRK]

Some clue that can lead us
to where she's being held![BRK]

She simply must be around
here somewhere...If only
I could see![BRK]

[POR02]
Are you sure, Lucia?[BRK]

[POR08]
Yes, the Goddess is in the
fifth tower![BRK]

Ghaleon mentioned it
earlier, but he did not
say where it was.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

There must be a way to
find it....[BRK]

.[BRK]

..[BRK]

...[BRK]

....Wait![BRK]

.....The pool! It must be
a Fountain of Transport![BRK]

...Ahh, yes! This has to
be the Fountain of Transport
that leads to the Goddess![BRK]

It was before me the entire
time, and yet I could not
see![BRK]

I must go...before Zophar
returns fully![END]

=== 1b | 1a67e | 9e ===
[POR02]
Ahhhhhh![BRK]

........Lucia!?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I can't believe she jumped.[BRK]

I hope she's right![BRK]

...Because I have a feeling
we're going in after her...[BRK]

...Right, Hiro?[END]
