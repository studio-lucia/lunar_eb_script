Donated 100s.[END]

=== 1 | 79f6 | 213 ===
What's an energetic group
of youngsters doin' in
this godforsaken place?[BRK]

Don't you know where you
kids are?[BRK]

This is Zaback, mining
town of the damned.[BRK]

Borgan controls this mine
with his black magic, and
we're his puppets.[BRK]

He forces us to work here
mining for precious Black
Dragon Diamonds...[BRK]

The magic in every diamond
we find only tightens his 
disgusting grip on us...[BRK]

So be warned! If you want to
get to the Minea Sea, go by
way of the lake to the east.[BRK]

This is no place for people
like you...Get lost before
Borgan finds you![END]

=== 2 | 7c1c | 75 ===
Cross through the cave on
the eastern end of the lake
to get to the Minea Sea.[BRK]

...It's a much safer route!
Good luck![END]

=== 3 | 7ca0 | 95 ===
Well, I can tell you that I,
for one, am glad to see
Zaback on the rise again![BRK]

We're well on our way to
returning to splendor as
a great mining town![END]

=== 4 | 7d48 | 21c ===
Have you seen the city that
hovers in the skies above?[BRK]

That's an imitation of
ancient Vane. Borgan calls
it 'Neo-Vane.'[BRK]

People who are not gifted
with magic ability are
barred from entering.[BRK]

Those that attempt the trial
to enter but fail it are
sent here...[BRK]

to labor their meaningless
lives away as slaves of
Borgan.[BRK]

[POR07]
But...Grandpa...I...[BRK]

[POR00]
Ah, Lemina, you were always
the kind one, weren't you?[BRK]

There's nothing you can do.
My fate was sealed the day
I tried to enter Neo-Vane.[BRK]

If I hadn't failed, I would
still be free...[BRK]

[POR07]
....
.....[END]

=== 5 | 7f7c | 35 ===
Don't worry about me...get
to what you've come to do![END]

=== 6 | 7fc8 | a5 ===
Did you see? Neo-Vane fell
to the ground![BRK]

Borgan's power must be
weakening! We're all free
again![BRK]

Thank you so much! I know
you had something to do with
all of this![END]

=== 7 | 8088 | 8b ===
I have always thought that
dividing people into groups
was a bad idea.[BRK]

The powerful ones always
oppress the weak. It's just
human nature...[END]

=== 8 | 8120 | 4e ===
[POR07]
Maybe now we can all just
get along, as the man of
oppression once pleaded.[END]

=== 9 | 817e | 92 ===
The sun is bright, and the
breeze is warm...Oh, it's
good to be alive![BRK]

On days like this, I gaze
upon the Blue Star and wish
I could live forever![END]

=== a | 8222 | 131 ===
Lemina, my dear...Come over
here and sit with me in the
warm morning sun...[BRK]

[POR07]
Grandpa, I don't have time
for that right now.[BRK]

I have to help Hiro, and
revive the Magic Guild, and
...and...and...oh pooh![BRK]

Grandpa, there's just too
much for me to do! I can't
sit with you today.[BRK]

How 'bout a raincheck, okay?[END]

=== b | 836a | 1b8 ===
Everything our lives will
be is determined when we
enter the Magic Trials.[BRK]

Failure results in a life
of back-breaking labor in
misery.[BRK]

Success leads to a life of
pleasant luxury in the
service of Master Borgan.[BRK]

It's all determined by one
small test...and nobody
forces you to take it...[BRK]

[POR07]
You...mean...you have to
work for free??! Why, that's
outrageous![BRK]

[POR02]
How is it that you always
seem to only tune in on the
money aspect of a problem?[END]

=== c | 853a | 64 ===
I wish I had never lusted
for a life in Neo-Vane...[BRK]

I'd be roaming free across
the land right now...[END]

=== d | 85b2 | 82 ===
Ha! The rulers of Neo-Vane
got what they deserved![BRK]

Who did they think they were
to decide the fate of the
people who came to them?[END]

=== e | 8642 | cc ===
[POR07]
Exactly! And to force you to
work for nothing is beyond
excusability![BRK]

Hrmph! In fact, I'd say it
was outright barbaric![BRK]

It does serve them right![BRK]

[POR02]
Lemina, Lemina...always the
same...Hoohmhmhommmm...[END]

=== f | 871e | 93 ===
I personally think that the
rulers of Neo-Vane should
take looks into account.[BRK]

If that were the only
criteria, I'm sure I'd be
one of the top guys![END]

=== 10 | 87be | 64 ===
[POR07]
Well, if you're using Borgan
as a comparison point, 
you are better looking.[BRK]

No doubt about it...[END]

=== 11 | 8836 | a7 ===
Zaback used to be a wealthy
mining town where everyone
was happy.[BRK]

But that disgusting pig
Borgan has totally corrupted
it.[BRK]

His oppression grows
stronger by the day...[END]

=== 12 | 88f4 | 3e ===
This policy of enslaving
those that fail the trials
is insane![END]

=== 13 | 8940 | 3b ===
[POR07]
Well then, why did you take
the test in the first place?[END]

=== 14 | 898e | 42 ===
Thank you! Thank you! Now
our town can return to its
former glory![END]

=== 15 | 89e0 | 4e ===
Zaback is the most powerful
and prosperous mining town
in the land once again![END]

=== 16 | 8a42 | d5 ===
The people of this sad town
are obsessed with training
their children to use magic.[BRK]

If their children learn
well, they can escape this
trap and enter Neo-Vane.[BRK]

It's a sad system, but at
least some children escape.[END]

=== 17 | 8b2e | 7b ===
I sometimes feel sorry for
the children forced to study
so hard...[BRK]

But their parents just want
something better for them...[END]

=== 18 | 8bbc | 8e ===
Ever since Neo-Vane fell
from the skies, the mood
here has lifted.[BRK]

I don't dare speak it, but
it almost seems as if the
miners have...hope![END]

=== 19 | 8c5a | 6f ===
I'm so happy that Zaback is
finally back to the way it
used to be.[BRK]

Now the children can just
act like children![END]

=== 1a | 8cdc | a2 ===
Ha! My father has made me
study magic for 15 years![BRK]

Soon, I will submit to the
trial to test my magic
ability.[BRK]

When I pass, I'll finally
get out of this rat trap![END]

=== 1b | 8d96 | 47 ===
I wish I didn't have to
leave my father behind when
I pass the trial...[END]

=== 1c | 8df0 | 87 ===
What? Neo-Vane fell from the
skies? That's impossible![BRK]

Borgan powers the city with
magic from the Black Dragon!
If that's true, then...[END]

=== 1d | 8e86 | 95 ===
Now I'm the strongest magic
user in Zaback, but no one
really cares...[BRK]

I'm glad I don't have to
submit to the trials,
though.[BRK]

They were for dorks...[END]

=== 1e | 8f2e | e1 ===
Dreb over there thinks he's
the center of the universe
'cause he has strong magic.[BRK]

I can't wait until he passes
the trial and gets out of
here.[BRK]

I'm tired of hearing all his
bragging, day in and day
out.[BRK]

Let me slave in peace![END]

=== 1f | 9026 | ae ===
Nobody down here likes
Borgan.[BRK]

We make up names for him
behind his back, like 'fart-
breath', or 'slug-lips.'[BRK]

I know, it's pretty lame,
but it sure does help pass
the time...[END]

=== 20 | 90e2 | 21 ===
[POR07]
....
....He he he...Slug lips![END]

=== 21 | 9116 | b8 ===
I don't think it's fair that
his royal fatness got to
decide...[BRK]

...who enters Neo-Vane, and
who didn't, just 'cause of
his stupid test![BRK]

I hope things change now
that he's been humbled![END]

=== 22 | 91dc | 7e ===
[POR07]
I think you're right. He
should definitely examine
the person's savings.[BRK]

[POR02]
Lemina...You have a one-
track mind, don't you?[END]

=== 23 | 926a | 77 ===
Thanks to the power of the
Black Dragon Diamond we now
control...[BRK]

...this town is once again
a happy, prosperous place![END]

=== 24 | 92ee | 7f ===
[POR07]
Well, when you're rich and
famous, send a little of the
dough my way, would ya?[BRK]

Remember, I helped make all
this possible...[END]

=== 25 | 9380 | ae ===
The people of Zaback have
many talents,[BRK]

but since Borgan prizes
magic above all else,[BRK]

...other forms of expression
are suppressed.[BRK]

It's really quite sad, to
tell the truth...[END]

=== 26 | 9446 | 97 ===
Because of that corrupt,
fat, floating pig, magic is
now prized above all else![BRK]

[POR07]
Magic is important, but the
way Borgan is cultivating it
is wrong...[END]

=== 27 | 94f0 | 70 ===
Now that Neo-Vane has fallen
from the sky, I think we
may have a chance.[BRK]

Borgan's power is not
totally absolute![END]

=== 28 | 9570 | fd ===
Magic is important, but it
is not the most important
thing.[BRK]

Borgan forgot that, but we
never must, lest we repeat
his mistakes.[BRK]

Think of all the wonderful
possibilities that are now
open to us![BRK]

[POR02]
Yes, imagine! You can now
shower more than once a
month![END]

=== 29 | 9680 | e2 ===
It's so sad when people are
judged only by the magic
ability they possess.[BRK]

It's such a narrow measure
of the whole person.[BRK]

I'll be glad when the day
comes that this system is
abolished...[BRK]

...And it is coming...I can
feel it...[END]

=== 2a | 977a | d9 ===
I am actually quite skilled
as a painter, but that is
overlooked by Borgan.[BRK]

He cares only for his
precious magic power...
It rules his life...[BRK]

He is merely a slave of
another master: namely, his
wanton lust for power.[END]

=== 2b | 9866 | 106 ===
In a town called Meribia,
I heard about a painting
exhibit they're having.[BRK]

The theme is female ghouls,
past and present.[BRK]

It seems a bit offbeat, but
I'm going to try to enter
one of my paintings in it.[BRK]

I just need to figure out a
way to smuggle it out of
here...[END]

=== 2c | 997c | 12a ===
I did get one of my 
paintings shown at the
exhibit in Meribia.[BRK]

I've heard that the response
was good, but...[BRK]

They said my paintings
weren't sensual enough![BRK]

I ask you...how is it
possible to make a female
ghoul more sensual?[BRK]

Lipstick? Earrings? Three
inch stiletto heels? It's
absolutely ludicrous![END]

=== 2d | 9ab4 | 2d ===
[POR07]
Ha! I'll bet Ramus is one
of the judges...[END]

=== 2e | 9af4 | c0 ===
Have you seen Neo-Vane, yet?
It flies free in the skies
above![BRK]

Borgan made it using the
power of the Black Dragon
Diamonds![BRK]

He keeps all of us mining
for more by using fear and
intimidation...[END]

=== 2f | 9bc6 | 117 ===
[POR07]
Well, maybe we should stick
around and help mine for
some of those diamonds...[BRK]

I bet they're worth a king's
ransom...[BRK]

[POR02]
Lemina! Is that all you ever
think about? C'mon! We've
got a job to do here![BRK]

[POR07]
Oh pooh! I was just thinking
out loud...[BRK]

You're absolutely no fun
at all...[END]

=== 30 | 9cf0 | be ===
Borgan controls all the
operations here in Zaback
Mine with magic.[BRK]

If any of us tries to steal
what we mine, he finds out
and punishes us severely.[BRK]

...And we're not talkin'
spanking here...[END]

=== 31 | 9dc6 | 7c ===
Will wonders never cease?!
Neo-Vane has been blown from
the sky![BRK]

Borgan's power must be
failing! Now is the time for
action![END]

=== 32 | 9e5e | 53 ===
At last we are free from the
chains of oppression Borgan
placed upon us. Thank you![END]

=== 33 | 9ec0 | d5 ===
We didn't appreciate the
freedom we had until we lost
it...almost for good.[BRK]

Now, once again, a singer
can freely sing. A painter
can freely paint...[BRK]

Our lives are returning to
normal...but we will never
forget...[END]

=== 34 | 9fa8 | a3 ===
Let's see...magic of Blaze,
magic of Blaze...First I
have to say...[BRK]

...Oh, what's the use! This
spell is so complicated I'll
never remember it![BRK]

I'm doomed to fail![END]

=== 35 | a062 | 4f ===
What I'd give to play with
my friends instead of
studying this crappy magic![END]

=== 36 | a0c4 | 9d ===
Since Neo-Vane fell from the
sky, there's really no point
to learning magic, is there?[BRK]

Good! I think I'll go play
with my friends![BRK]

Magic was boring anyway...[END]

=== 37 | a170 | cd ===
Me and my friends are plan-
ning to sneak into Neo-Vane
and set up a secret base![BRK]

It's gonna be so cool!
Ha ha ha ha ha![BRK]

[POR02]
Hmmm...Sounds like another
little lost boy I know...
I wonder if they're related![END]

=== 38 | a250 | e3 ===
Before Borgan built Neo-Vane
and set up shop here, Zaback
was very prosperous.[BRK]

Everyone wanted to live here
and mine for Black Dragon
Diamonds.[BRK]

The mine kept giving them
and never seemed to run out.
It was too good to last...[END]

=== 39 | a34a | cb ===
These days, Borgan rules the
roost, so to speak. He takes
every diamond we mine.[BRK]

And every diamond he takes
makes him more and more
powerful.[BRK]

It's a vicious cycle that we
don't have the power to
break...[END]

=== 3a | a42c | 87 ===
Now that Borgan's evil
influence has been removed,[BRK]

Zaback should bounce back in
no time! In fact, we'll be
better than ever. I know it![END]

=== 3b | a4ce | 42 ===
It's up to us now to return
Zaback to the town we all
once knew...[END]

=== 3c | a520 | 99 ===
If there's one thing we've
learned during Zophar's
oppression, it's that...[BRK]

to prize one ability higher
than all others serves only
to limit ourselves...[END]

=== 3d | a5cc | d5 ===
I want to be a knight for
Goddess Althena, like White
Knight Leo.[BRK]

To become a knight for
Althena, I don't have to
have magic ability, do I?[BRK]

I hope not, because my magic
abilities are off the bottom
of the chart...[END]

=== 3e | a6b8 | 7b ===
Gruel, gruel, the magical
soup, the more you slurp,
the more you poop...[BRK]

Ha ha ha ha ha....I just
made that up. Funny, huh?[END]

=== 3f | a746 | af ===
Jingle bells, Borgan smells,
fartin' all the day...[BRK]

Stinkin's real, what's the
deal? His undies gettin'
gray...hey![BRK]

Ha ha ha ha ha....I just
made that up. I'm on a roll
today![END]

=== 40 | a804 | 66 ===
I don't make up songs any
more...that stuff is for
children.[BRK]

I've grown out of doing all
that stuff...[END]

=== 41 | a870 | 10 ===
Zaback Mine Town[END]

=== 42 | cc7e | 7e ===
All the miners here are
slaves of their greed for
power.[BRK]

All failed the Trial of
Borgan, and so must work
here until they die.[END]

=== 43 | cd10 | 7a ===
The men of Zaback all have
the same dream: returning
Zaback to its former glory.[BRK]

One day it will happen. I
just know it...[END]

=== 44 | cd9a | 4c ===
If we work hard enough,
Zaback can be as rich and
prosperous as it once was.[END]

=== 45 | cdf6 | 98 ===
Because we failed the Trial
of Borgan, we are forced to
slave for his evil means.[BRK]

Every Black Dragon Diamond
we recover seals our fate
a little tighter.[END]

=== 46 | cea2 | a2 ===
When I was down in one of
the lowest levels of the
mine,[BRK]

there was suddenly a violent
shaking that nearly crushed
the mine shaft![BRK]

I was mighty scared, I tell
you![END]

=== 47 | cf54 | ba ===
The job of mining for
diamonds is unique in all
the world.[BRK]

There's nothing quite like
uncovering a precious Black
Dragon Diamond.[BRK]

Each one is so valuable, men
have even killed over them![END]

=== 48 | d01c | b9 ===
[POR07]
Oh pooh! You're pulling my
leg now! But say, you
wouldn't mind showing me...[BRK]

[POR02]
Lemina, we do not have time
for this man to show you a
diamond you can't have![BRK]

Get a clue, bird-brain![END]

=== 49 | d0e8 | 6e ===
Oh, how I wish I'd never
submitted to Borgan's Magic
Trial![BRK]

Now my family is enslaved
to him for generations.[END]

=== 4a | d16e | 5d ===
Borgan got the power to
create Neo-Vane from the
diamonds of this mine.[BRK]

Didn't you know that?[END]

=== 4b | d1de | 6f ===
Since we no longer have to
slave for Borgan,[BRK]

we can now use the diamonds
we mine to rebuild the town
of Zaback![END]

=== 4c | d25c | 75 ===
People come from all over to
try to buy Black Dragon
Diamonds.[BRK]

I think it's because of the
magic powers they contain.[END]

=== 4d | d2e4 | be ===
We are forced to labor for
Borgan.[BRK]

Everyone here has failed the
Magic Trial, and so Borgan
knows he can dominate them.[BRK]

[POR07]
That's positively inhuman!
I can't believe anyone could
be so cruel![END]

=== 4e | d3ba | 77 ===
I wish I had never even seen
that damned floating city![BRK]

It's been nothing but ruin
ever since I tried to pass
the test![END]

=== 4f | d444 | 76 ===
People of the land are in a
panic now that Neo-Vane's
fallen.[BRK]

Hmmm...I wonder if Neo-
Vane's fall means we're
free...?[END]

=== 50 | d4ca | 6f ===
Workin' in an old mine,
goin' 'round, 'round,
'round...[BRK]

Workin' in an old mine,
whoop! 'Cause Vane fell
down...[END]

=== 51 | d54c | 5f ===
Have you seen Neo-Vane?[BRK]

Borgan is hatching a plan to
rule the world from his
floating fortress![END]

=== 52 | d5c2 | 45 ===
If Borgan rules the world,
it will all become like
Zaback - terrible.[END]

=== 53 | d61e | 78 ===
They say that the person
who defeated Borgan was
lord of the Magic Guild.[BRK]

Hooray for them! They've
given us our freedom![END]

=== 54 | d6b2 | 3e ===
I'm glad that Borgan has
been shown the light
...so to speak.[END]

=== 55 | d6fe | 24 ===
[POR07]
He's definitely been
enlightened.[END]

=== 56 | d732 | 85 ===
I heard that the person who
defeated Zophar was leader
of Vane's Magic Guild![BRK]

[POR02]
T-That's not true! How do
these rumors get started?[END]

=== 57 | d7c4 | 85 ===
[POR07]
You know, Ruby...Someone
calls 'The Star' and offers
to make up a story for 100s.[BRK]

Happens all the time. You
should get used to it.[END]

=== 58 | d85c | c0 ===
The people of this mine have
no magic power, but the ones
in town have a little.[BRK]

Jealousy is often the cause
of fights around here.[BRK]

It's so sad. Borgan has
turned us even against each
other...[END]

I used to be a teacher in

but I came here to try to
teach the children magic...[END]

They must be paying you a

However, this school will

In order to open another
school in Zaback, I've got
to have a lot of money.[BRK]

That's why I'm teaching and
mining here.[BRK]

I teach by day and mine by
night. It sucks, but...[BRK]

If I can just find ten more
diamonds, I can open the
school![END]

=== 5d | db68 | cf ===
Many of the miners here were
here before Borgan took
control.[BRK]

But the rest were all sent
here when they failed his

That man over there is
teaching the children to use
magic so they can get out.[END]

=== 5e | dc4e | d7 ===
I've worked at this mine
since I was a child. I'm
used to the hard work.[BRK]

Now, the teacher over there

That big baby...[END]

Don't bother me...okay?[END]

But you'd have to be crazy
to go in those joints![END]

=== 74 | fff2 | 11a ===
Did you hear the rumor that
there's treasure in the
Dragon's Nest?[BRK]

I just heard another one
that says there's even
treasure in Lionhead![BRK]

The only problem is that
those places are crawlin'
with creepies of every sort![BRK]

You'd have to be out of your
friggin' mind to go in
either place![END]

=== 75 | 10128 | ea ===
Say, if you really want to
test your skill, try looking
for the hidden treasures.[BRK]

There's s'posed to be one
at Lionhead, east of the
Minea Sea...[BRK]

...and another one in the
Dragon's Nest, somewhere
around Raculi![BRK]

Think you're up to it?[END]

=== 76 | 10226 | 81 ===
I've heard the stories of
treasure at Lionhead and in
the Dragon's Nest.[BRK]

But I've never heard the one
about the Dragon Eye Jewel.[END]

=== 77 | 102be | 4e ===
Nope. Never heard any rumor
of a Dragon Eye Jewel
anywhere 'round here.[BRK]

Sorry.[END]

My son studied hard and
passed Borgan's Magic Trial.[BRK]

I'm so happy that he passed
and can now study in Neo-
Vane, but...[BRK]

...I...I...miss him...so
very much...[END]

=== 79 | 103d4 | 4e ===
Even though I miss my son,
I'm happy he is in a place
where he can be happy...[END]

=== 7a | 1043a | 84 ===
Now it doesn't matter if
you have magic power or not.[BRK]

It seems anyone can get into
Neo-Vane since its fall. I'm
going to see my son![END]

=== 7b | 104da | 8f ===
I gan goh see mah son iif

My son says that he is
coming back to look after
me.[BRK]

That boy worries too much!
I don't have a problem...[END]

=== 7d | 105f4 | 1e5 ===
Hey...Come close and I'll
tell you the old woman's
story...[BRK]

You see, a long time ago,
her husband died, but not
before giving her a son.[BRK]

She made the boy study very
hard, and it paid off
because he passed the trial.[BRK]

Now that he's in Neo-Vane,
she's become a pathetic,
sobbing alcoholic.[BRK]

I think it's because her son
went away like her husband,[BRK]

and even though her son's
still alive, she can never
see him.[BRK]

You see, her magic power's
too low to gain entrance to
Neo-Vane, even to visit.[END]

=== 7e | 107f0 | fb ===
I feel so sorry for the old
lady, but what can you do?
It's hopeless.[BRK]

[POR07]
Well, maybe you can start a
local chapter of 'AA' and
get her the help she needs![BRK]

Remember, I get half the
profits of the refreshments
at the meetings![BRK]

After all, it was my idea![END]

=== 7f | 108fe | 65 ===
I'm so happy that the woman
can see her son again![BRK]

Now, if only she can solve
her drinking problem...[END]

=== 80 | 10972 | 13b ===
I heard a new rumor that the
way Zophar was defeated was
incredible...[BRK]

[POR02]
How do these rumors get
started?![BRK]

[POR00]
In fact, eyewitness accounts
say that somehow Michael and
Lisa-Marie were involved![BRK]

Something about magic,
monkeys, makeup, Elvis,
and....[BRK]

...Tito![BRK]

[POR02]
Oouhh, is there ever an end
to these bizarre stories?[END]

=== 81 | 10ac0 | 8e ===
Say there, strangers, is
this your first time in
Zaback's bar?[BRK]

Listen up! Our brew is world
renowned for the way it
restores your magic power![END]

=== 82 | 10b66 | ab ===
Go on, order a drink![BRK]

Your magic power could
become strong enough to gain
entrance to Neo-Vane![BRK]

Even if it doesn't, you'll
still be flying high! What
have you got to lose?[END]

=== 83 | 10c24 | 4c ===
Even if you have no
aspirations to anything
higher,[BRK]

you should try our brew![END]

=== 84 | 10c80 | 96 ===
Now that Borgan has been
defeated and everyone keeps
what they mine,[BRK]

business is the best it's
been in 10 years![BRK]

Why not order a drink and
celebrate?![END]

Is my wife okay, mishter?
<Hick>[END]

=== 88 | 10eec | cc ===
Hey! Bet you didn't
recognize me sober! [BRK]

My wife came back to me when
she heard I cleaned up my
act![BRK]

She wants me to live in Neo-
Vane with her, and I'm gonna
take her up on her offer![BRK]

Wish me luck! Haha![END]

=== 89 | 10fcc | 9a ===
Did you know that Borgan
used to be an inferior
member of the Guild?[BRK]

It's funny that he would put
such emphasis on magic power
when he was so bad at it...[END]

=== 8a | 1107e | 98 ===
It's strange to me that a
person with inferior magic
status in the Guild could...[BRK]

...go on to control all of
Neo-Vane, and our lives. How
does he do it?[END]

=== 8b | 11124 | 3f ===
[POR07]
It's a secret that I must
unravel, if I'm to help my
mother![END]

=== 8c | 11176 | 7d ===
What? You guys defeated
Borgan? That's the best news
I've heard all year![BRK]

Now that slime factory will
never bother us again. [END]

=== 8d | 11202 | 9e ===
I heard that Miria and
Borgan were planning on
getting married!!!??[BRK]

Is that true?[BRK]

If it is, they're gonna
have some butt-ugly babies![BRK]

I can see it now...Whoo![END]

=== 8e | 112ae | e3 ===
[POR07]
That's not true! I won't let
it happen![BRK]

I don't care how nice he's
become![BRK]

There's not enough money in
the world to buy my blessing
on that marriage![BRK]

True love or not, I will not
let my mother marry that...
that...bullfrog![END]

Slaving in the mines is a
life not even fit for a
dog.[BRK]

I love my child, and so
I want only the best for
him.[BRK]

Therefore, I will do my best
to bring out his magic power
so he can pass the trial.[BRK]

That way, he can live on as
one of the elite in Neo-
Vane.[BRK]

[POR07]
But...if he goes there,
you'll never see him again!
That's so...sad....[END]

=== 91 | 11d52 | 65 ===
I've taught my son every-
thing I can about magic.[BRK]

All I can do now is pray
he passes Borgan's trial![END]

=== 92 | 11dce | 5d ===
Is it true?! Rumors are
flying all over the place
that Neo-Vane fell![BRK]

If that's true, then...[END]

=== 93 | 11e46 | 56 ===
Now that Neo-Vane has
fallen, I don't need to
pressure my son to study.[BRK]

What a relief![END]

=== 94 | 11eac | 79 ===
My son has decided to be an
adventurer![BRK]

He goes out every day and
explores the area around
Zaback.[BRK]

We're so proud of him![END]

=== 95 | 11f38 | ca ===
Son, get back to your
studies! Remember, the trial
is only three days away![BRK]

If you forget the magic
you've learned, you'll be
enslaved at the mines![BRK]

Your father and I don't want
that, so please...study![END]

=== 96 | 1201a | 5d ===
Didn't you hear me, boy! I
said the Magic Trial is
three days away![BRK]

Get back to your studies![END]

=== 97 | 1208a | 7c ===
I heard that all the Magic
Trials have been canceled
since Neo-Vane fell.[BRK]

That's such good news! Now
my son can stay here...[END]

=== 98 | 12114 | 91 ===
[POR07]
Well, I wouldn't count on
him staying forever...[BRK]

Pretty soon girls are going
to start noticing him, and
then,[BRK]

you can kiss your boy good-
bye![END]

=== 99 | 121b4 | 96 ===
I'm trying to come to grips
with my little boy out in 
the big, bad world![BRK]

It's so frightening! I wish
he'd just play with the
other boys around here![END]

=== 9a | 1225e | 102 ===
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Three more
days 'til the Magic Trial.
So what?[BRK]

I don't want to pass the
test and be carted off to
some fancy city![BRK]

Enslaved or not, I want to 
stay here with my family![BRK]

[POR07]
That's so sweet! You'd give
up your future to stay with
your family![END]

=== 9b | 12378 | 4e ===
Nag, nag, nag! Can't she
understand that I don't want
to go to Neo-Vane? Hmmm?[END]

=== 9c | 123da | 72 ===
I've decided I want to be
an adventurer, like you
guys![BRK]

But I guess that means I'll
have to leave my parents,
huh?[END]

=== 9d | 1245a | 4d ===
[POR07]
Yep, 'fraid so. It's a big,
bad world out there. I think
you'll like it...[END]

=== 9e | 124b6 | a1 ===
I've gone out every day to
explore the area around here
to train as an adventurer.[BRK]

It's kinda fun, really. Sure
beats the heck out of
studying magic outta books![END]

=== 9f | 12564 | d1 ===
[POR07]
Well, if you find any
treasures in your quests, be
sure to bring them to me.[BRK]

Many treasures are cursed. I
can remove the curse for a
small fee.[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, Lemina! Will you ever
change? You're hopeless![END]

=== a0 | 12648 | 98 ===
I feel kinda bad for my big
brother...[BRK]

Mom and Dad are always
yelling at him to do better
in his magic studies.[BRK]

I think it gets him kinda
down, ya know?[END]

I sure hope all the studying
my brother is doing pays
off...[END]

I don't want my brother to
go away, but if he passes
the trial, he will.[END]

Hey, don't worry, all the
Magic Trials have been done
away with![BRK]

[POR00]
Really?! Oh, this is great!
My prayers must have reached
Goddess Althena![END]

My big brother is really
good to me.[BRK]

If he becomes an adventurer,
he'll bring me back all
sorts of good things![BRK]

I'm sad to see him go, but
this time I know he'll be
able to come back.[END]

well! He'll pass his trial

In fact, he's doing much
better than that imbecile
next door.[END]

My son is definitely more
talented with magic than
that dullard next door![BRK]

That kid can barely tie his

If Neo-Vane fell, what does
that do for my son's chances
of passing his trial?[BRK]

What? There are no more
trials? We're free? But...
I wanted to...[END]

I was so wrapped up in my
son passing his trial it
didn't hit me until now...[BRK]

No more Borgan means that
we can leave Zaback any

We're truly free again![END]

My son is so talented that
he'll be a success wherever

I've heard that the Magic
Guild in Vane is being re-

Maybe he should try to get
in there...[END]

=== ac | 1338c | 192 ===
[POR07]
Well, to enter the Magic
Guild of Vane, he'd have
to learn humility.[BRK]

Magic ability isn't the only
criteria of the Guild of
Vane.[BRK]

...If he pays me, I might
be able to teach him
humility...[BRK]

[POR02]
Lemina, I can't believe it!
You're still trying to run
new scams! You're shameless![BRK]

My son is so smart he makes

Mentally challenged? Huh?
What's...[BRK]

She means retarded, flea-
brain![END]

His parents must be so
embarrassed! I know I'd be![END]

It doesn't really matter
that Neo-Vane fell.[BRK]

My son's still a genius.
He'll find another calling,

next door. Ha ha ha ha ha![END]

My son is so smart that I'm

I'm also certain the kid
next door will be a massive
draw on the welfare system.[END]

In fact, I don't think the
neighbor boy even has the
IQ for butt-wiping.[BRK]

...His own included. Lord!
His parents must be so very
embarrassed![END]

I am thoroughly prepared

In fact, I can't wait until
it's time for me to actually
take the test.[BRK]

I suspect that I'll have the
highest rating of all the
applicants this year.[BRK]

But that shouldn't be a
surprise to anyone, as I do
come from superior stock.[BRK]

If you're that skilled, why
not apply to the Magic Guild
of Vane?[BRK]

[POR00]
Vane? Are you kidding? That
place is for unskilled
people of the old order...[BRK]

I thought that inferior 
clan had decayed well past
repair by now.[BRK]

Why you little!...I suspect
you need to have your butt

Maybe it'll knock some of

Well, if you'll lose the
