Calm your fear and take

Ah! Lucia...You have come![BRK]

But...were you summoned by
Althena?[BRK]

How did you know of my
terrible plight?[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

I came here to stop Zophar,
and Nall told me how to
break the seal binding you.[BRK]

In order to get to Althena,
we had to release all of the
bound Dragonpower.[BRK]

Zophar is planning to
decimate this world,[BRK]

and I believe that only
Althena's power can stop
him.[BRK]

[POR26]
Lucia, I feel the conflict
deep within your soul.[BRK]

You are the key to Althena's
plan...[BRK]

[POR08]
You know of Althena's plan?[BRK]

You must tell me what it
is![BRK]

[POR26]
....
.....[BRK]

All will be revealed in
due time...[BRK]

Once the Red Dragon has
claimed her power,[BRK]

we will have all the power
necessary to break the seal
binding the Goddess Tower.[BRK]

I will not see you again
until that time.[BRK]

Until then, look deep within
your soul and believe in the
unbelievable...[END]

I can't believe we actually
revived the Black Dragon![BRK]

Um, that only leaves....[END]

Hiro, how can you hold out
any hope of reaching the
Blue Star?[BRK]

The path you've chosen is
strewn with difficulty.[BRK]

Why do you wish to go there?[BRK]

[POR01]
Because Lucia is there...[BRK]

I-I can't leave her all
alone...[BRK]

[POR26]
Ahhh! I understand your
plight all too well...[BRK]

If you believe in yourself,
nothing can stand long
before you.[BRK]

Perhaps you and Lucia can
restore the Blue Star to
its former glory...[END]

=== d | 26dae | 63 ===
[POR26]
Perhaps one day, the dragons
of Althena can return to
the Blue Star.[BRK]

You can make that happen...[END]

=== e | 26e24 | 92 ===
[POR02]
We've revived all but the
Red Dragon.[BRK]

Hiro, I don't know if I'm
ready to face my destiny.[BRK]

I...I know it sounds silly,
but I'm kind of...scared.[END]
