Ah! Lucia...you have come![BRK]

But...were you summoned by
althena?[BRK]

How did you know of my
terrible plight?[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

I came here to stop zophar,
and nall told me how to
break the seal binding you.[BRK]

In order to get to althena,
we had to release all of the
bound dragonpower.[BRK]

Zophar is planning to
decimate this world,[BRK]

and i believe that only
althena's power can stop
him.[BRK]

[POR26]
Lucia, i feel the conflict
deep within your soul.[BRK]

You are the key to althena's
plan...[BRK]

[POR08]
You know of althena's plan?[BRK]

You must tell me what it
is![BRK]

[POR26]
....
.....[BRK]

All will be revealed in
due time...[BRK]

Once the red dragon has
claimed her power,[BRK]

we will have all the power
necessary to break the seal
binding the goddess tower.[BRK]

I will not see you again
until that time.[BRK]

Until then, look deep within
your soul and believe in the
unbelievable...

I can't believe we actually
revived the black dragon![BRK]

Um, that only leaves....[END]

Hiro, how can you hold out
any hope of reaching the
blue star?[BRK]

The path you've chosen is
strewn with difficulty.[BRK]

Why do you wish to go there?[BRK]

[POR01]
Because lucia is there...[BRK]

I-i can't leave her all
alone...[BRK]

[POR26]
Ahhh! I understand your
plight all too well...[BRK]

If you believe in yourself,
nothing can stand long
before you.[BRK]

Perhaps you and lucia can
restore the blue star to
its former glory...
[END]

[POR26]
Perhaps one day, the dragons
of althena can return to
the blue star.[BRK]

You can make that happen...[END]

[POR02]
We've revived all but the
red dragon.[BRK]

Hiro, i don't know if i'm
ready to face my destiny.[BRK]

I...i know it sounds silly,
but i'm kind of...scared.[END]
