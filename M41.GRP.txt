Halt! You have no business
aboard the dragon steam-
ship destiny![BRK]

You'd better leave before
lord leo returns from
gwyn's house![END]

=== 1 | 95d0 | 49 ===
[POR02]
Hiro? What is lord leo
doing at grandpa's house?
We'd better find out![END]

=== 2 | 962c | 8e ===
This is the dragonship
destiny, pride of the
entire althena guard![BRK]

What? Lord leo? He's
retired to his quarters.
You'd better not bother him.
[END]

=== 3 | 96c8 | 43 ===
[POR04]
But i must tell him of
the events at the blue
tower! Let us in!
[END]

=== 4 | 971a | 3b ===
This area is off-limits
without the permission
of lord leo.[END]

=== 5 | 9764 | 67 ===
Halt! Who goes there?![BRK]

Freakin' thrill-seekers!
If ya don't vacate the ship
right now, i'll haul ya in![END]

The dragon ship destiny was
given to lord leo by the
goddess althena.[BRK]

It is equipped with a mighty
white dragon cannon at its
bow.[END]

=== 7 | 986c | 8f ===
We are retained by the
goddess althena herself to
keep our world from harm.[BRK]

This ship draws on her
power, and lord leo
answers directly to her.[END]

=== 8 | 990a | b9 ===
The goddess althena is
fairest of the fair.[BRK]

I saw her once, and i'll
never forget it...[BRK]

That milky skin, the curve
of her hips,...those smooth,
supple br...[BRK]

.............uh, never mind![END]

=== 9 | 99ea | 7d ===
[POR09]
Ha ha ha ha!
Is that everything you've
got, my boy?[BRK]

With such paltry skill,
you don't stand a chance
of changing anything![END]

=== a | 9a74 | c0 ===
[POR09]
Hiro, your skill is without
equal. Perhaps you are the
one of legend.[BRK]

Please take this. It holds
the power of the white
dragon within it.[BRK]

aura from lord leo.[END]

=== b | 9b3e | d3 ===
[POR09]
The white dragon sleeps
within the iceburg of the
north sea.[BRK]

Take my ship. It will get
you there swiftly. You've
no time to waste![BRK]

Take to the seas outside
meribia and use the helm
of the destiny to navigate.[END]

=== c | 9c1a | 10b ===
[POR09]
The time has come for me
to relinquish command of
the destiny.[BRK]

Take the helm, hiro. You are
now the destiny's captain.[BRK]

I cannot remain with you to
fight, so it is here that
we must part ways.[BRK]

[POR01]
But....leo.[BRK]

[POR09]
Fight bravely, fight well,
and most of all fight fair.[END]

=== d | 9d44 | 67 ===

Come on, lad! I know you
can do better than that![BRK]

I'll give you another shot.

[POR02]
Hey! Hey, hiro! Let's get
this ship moving![BRK]

Didn't leo say that we
could move the ship from
the helm?[BRK]

Hop to it, buster![END]

=== 10 | 9e80 | 18a ===
[POR02]
Hiro! Lucia! Look! It's the
port of pentagulia![BRK]

[POR08]
I'm certain that althena's
impostor has closed the
transmission spring by now.[BRK]

So, the only way to get back
to althena's tower will be
to break zopahr's seal.[BRK]

Once we arrive, i can try to
use dragonpower to break it.[BRK]

Hopefully there will be
enough power...and then...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Oh, althena must trust me,
even if the result is...[BRK]

[POR01]
.....?[END]

=== 11 | a014 | 1f0 ===
[ROR08]
I know your plan, ghaleon.[BRK]

You have joined with zopahr
to destroy this world![BRK]

[ROR14]
Me? Destroy the world?
Oh dear, that sounds so,
so,...barbaric.[BRK]

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmm...[BRK]

I love it.[BRK]

But don't confuse my
intentions, sweet child.[BRK]

I fully intend to recreate
the world with zophar once
the impurities are removed.[BRK]

And, i've decided to start
my impurity abatement 
program with you, lucia.[BRK]

Wave bye-bye to your little
boyfriend, dear.[BRK]

I sense a coming....chill
in your relationship...[BRK]

Ha ha ha ha ha!
[END]

=== 12 | a20e | 2f3 ===
[ROR14]
Hrmph! What a seriously
confused little boy.[BRK]

If he had minded his own
business, he'd still be
alive.[BRK]

But now that he's out of
the way, lucia is all mine![BRK]

[ROR08]
Hiro!?...hiro!!!
Nooooooo![BRK]

[ROR14]
....
.....[BRK]

[ROR08]
Hiro! Why did you...[BRK]

[ROR14]
Ha ha ha! Poor, lost, little
lucia. You care for hiro
more than yourself.[BRK]

That's so touching. You
know, there is a way you can
save your true love...[BRK]

If you were to give me the
secret of the blue tower's
true power, i could...[BRK]

[ROR08]
Ghaleon! How do you know
about the blue tower's
secret power?![BRK]

[ROR14]
Ha ha ha. I know many 
things, my dear.[BRK]

I also know that you now 
control the destiny of your
little hiro.[BRK]

Go to pentagulia and finish
your mission, or return to 
the blue tower to save hiro.[BRK]

It's up to you...hm hm hm
hm hm hm....
[END]

=== 13 | a522 | 16e ===
[POR02]
Oh no! Hiro! Hiro!
Lucia, you have to save
hiro! Please???[BRK]

[POR05]
Looks like our luck's taken
a turn for the worse...
damn that ghaleon![BRK]

[POR07]
If ghaleon can change a
human into crystal, who can
stop him?[BRK]

[POR10]
Lucia has the power to save
hiro and stop ghaleon...he
said it himself...[BRK]

[POR08]
If i use the secret power of
the blue tower, i can save
hiro...[BRK]

....but that would...[END]

=== 14 | a6b0 | 1c6 ===

.....hiro.[BRK]

If the world is destroyed
because of my decision,
you'll never forgive me.[BRK]

Before i met you, my 
thoughts were so clear.[BRK]

I had simply to come here
and accomplish my simple
mission. But now...[BRK]

Oh, hiro! What shall i do?
Nothing makes sense anymore.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Regardless of what happens,
know that i will always...[BRK]

[POR02]
...lucia! It's the blue
tower! We're here! Let's
get moving and restore hiro![BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

...okay, ruby. I'm coming.[END]

=== 15 | a88e | 1cd ===
[POR01]
C'mon, lucia! Grandpa
gwyn is waiting for us![BRK]

[POR08]
Yes, i suppose we should
continue on...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...but...[BRK]

[POR01]
But what, lucia?
What's the matter?[BRK]

[POR08]
No...nothing. Forget it.[BRK]

I'm just glad to know
that someone will always
be here for me.[BRK]

[POR01]
That's kind of a weird
thing to say out of the
blue...[BRK]

Of course you'll always
have me around![BRK]

[POR08]
Y-you're right. From now
on, no more bad thoughts![BRK]

Okay. As ruby would say,[BRK]

'let's get this show on
the road, hiro!'
[END]

=== 16 | aa68 | 229 ===
[POR01]
Penny for your thoughts,
lucia.[BRK]

[POR08]
Hmm? Oh, hiro.[BRK]

[POR01]
You seemed to be lost in
pretty deep thought. What
were you thinking about?[BRK]

[POR08]
Oh, nothing, really...[BRK]

I-i was just wishing we
could continue this journey
forever...[BRK]

I know, it's silly.[BRK]

[POR01]
Oh, lucia. It's not that
stupid.[BRK]

I've had that same thought
myself. Ya know, after we
visit gramps,[BRK]

we can take the destiny and
start another adventure![BRK]

Whaddaya think? Cool, huh?[BRK]

[POR08]
That sounds lovely, hiro.
I'd die to do that...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

[POR01]
Okay then! We'll call it
a plan! I can't wait!
This'll be great![END]

=== 17 | ac9a | fc ===
[POR01]
It looks like we're here.
We'd better get moving! I
can't wait to tell grand...[BRK]

[POR08]
...wait! Hiro, i'd like to
stop at the blue tower
first.[BRK]

[POR01]
But...lucia? Why can't we
visit grandpa gwyn first?[BRK]

[POR08]
Please, hiro? For me?[BRK]

[POR01]
...okay, lucia. For you.

[END]

=== 18 | adbe | b9 ===
[POR02]
Remember, leo said the cave
of the white dragon was in
an iceberg by the north sea.[BRK]

If we leave meribia's port
and head west, we're sure
to find it.[BRK]

Let's go, hiro! Adventure
awaits![END]

=== 19 | aeaa | 51 ===

There's no time for
indecision, lad! Zophar
will be here any time![BRK]

Let's move![END]

=== 1a | af0e | bf ===
[POR08]
Oh, hiro. You sacrificed
your life, so that i 
could live.[BRK]

I owe you everything.[BRK]

[POR02]
Lucia, we have to hurry
and get to the blue spire
to restore hiro.[BRK]

[POR08]
But there's no time.
Zophar is...
[END]

=== 1b | afe0 | 83 ===
[POR08]
Oh, hiro! How can i even
consider leaving you in
this state?![BRK]

There must be a way to
revive you and still take
care of zophar...[END]

=== 1c | b070 | 4f ===
[POR08]
But my first priority is
to use the power of the 
blue spire to revive you.
[END]

=== 1d | b0d6 | 1eb ===
[POR05]
Are you going to save 
hiro by using the power
of the blue spire?[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

Ronfar, continue the course
to pentagulia.[BRK]

[POR05]
But that's the opposite
direction of the blue spire![BRK]

If you don't go there and
restore hiro, that will be
the....end...of.....him...[BRK]

[POR02]
He was stricken trying to
save your life! How can you
turn your back on him now?[BRK]

[POR08]
Ruby, please understand. I
must accomplish my task, or
all will be...[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm not listening! La la la
la la la la la la la la la 
la la la.....[END]

=== 1e | b2d8 | 2e7 ===
[POR05]
Listen, i know how important
it is not to let zophar 
revive, [BRK]

but i will not let hiro die
like this! I'm going to the
port at dalton.[BRK]

I can take him to the blue
spire from there.[BRK]

Maybe i can figure out how
to revive him. You can do
what you want.[BRK]

[POR08]
Ronfar, you don't understand
anything![BRK]

If zophar revives before
althena, he will seize
althena's power,[BRK]

and become the most powerful
being in the universe,[BRK]

with the absolute power of
creation and destruction.[BRK]

Once his evil is infused
with this power, it will be
the end of everything![BRK]

This is our only chance to
stop him.[BRK]

[POR02]
But lucia...[BRK]

[POR08]
I am lucia, guardian of the
blue star. I came here to
save the world.[BRK]

I must continue my mission,
regardless of the cost.[BRK]

Do what you must, ronfar.
[END]

=== 1f | b5c8 | 49 ===
[POR05]

is the last chance to save
hiro![BRK]

[POR08]
....

[END]

=== 20 | b628 | 106 ===
[POR05]
I knew you'd change your
mind, lucia.[BRK]

I know that you are gambling
with the fate of both our
worlds to do this.[BRK]

But you're doing the right
thing by going to the blue
spire first to save hiro.[BRK]

Trust me...it'll all be
peachy keen, jelly bean.
...you'll see....
[END]

=== 21 | b742 | 9b ===
[POR10]
Lucia...why do you hesitate?
You aren't thinking of
letting hiro die, are you?[BRK]

I know you're not that
cold-hearted! You simply
can't be...[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[END]

=== 22 | b7f0 | 98 ===
[POR10]
Whew! For a while there, I
was worried that you were
going to let hiro die![BRK]

But you've now shown that
you have the one trait I
prize most: integrity.[END]

=== 23 | b89c | b4 ===
[POR07]
With money, practically
anything is possible...[BRK]

But i'm pretty sure that
there's no way we can buy
hiro back from the dead.[BRK]

You've got to save him,
lucia![BRK]

[POR08]
But lemina...i....

blue spire to revive you.

[POR05]
Are you going to save 
hiro by using the power
of the blue spire?[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

Ronfar, continue the course
to pentagulia.[BRK]

[POR05]
But that's the opposite
direction of the blue spire![BRK]

If you don't go there and
restore hiro, that will be
the....end...of.....him...[BRK]

[POR02]
He was stricken trying to
save your life! How can you
turn your back on him now?[BRK]

[POR08]
Ruby, please understand. I
must accomplish my task, or
all will be...[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm not listening! La la la
la la la la la la la la la 
la la la.....[END]

Listen, i know how important
it is not to let zophar 
revive, [BRK]

but i will not let hiro die
like this! I'm going to the
port at dalton.[BRK]

I can take him to the blue
spire from there.[BRK]

Maybe i can figure out how
to revive him. You can do
what you want.[BRK]

[POR08]
Ronfar, you don't understand
anything![BRK]

If zophar revives before
althena, he will seize
althena's power,[BRK]

and become the most powerful
being in the universe,[BRK]

with the absolute power of
creation and destruction.[BRK]

Once his evil is infused
with this power, it will be
the end of everything![BRK]

This is our only chance to
stop him.[BRK]

[POR02]
But lucia...[BRK]

[POR08]
I am lucia, guardian of the
blue star. I came here to
save the world.[BRK]

I must continue my mission,
regardless of the cost.[BRK]

Do what you must, ronfar.
[END]

[POR05]
But lucia...wait! This
is the last chance to save
hiro![BRK]

[POR08]

=== 46 | e3fa | 106 ===
[POR05]
I knew you'd change your
mind, lucia.[BRK]

I know that you are gambling
with the fate of both our
worlds to do this.[BRK]

But you're doing the right
thing by going to the blue
spire first to save hiro.[BRK]

Trust me...it'll all be
peachy keen, jelly bean.
...you'll see....
[END]

=== 47 | e514 | 9b ===
[POR10]
Lucia...why do you hesitate?
You aren't thinking of
letting hiro die, are you?[BRK]

I know you're not that
cold-hearted! You simply
can't be...[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[END]

=== 48 | e5c2 | 98 ===
[POR10]
Whew! For a while there, I
was worried that you were
going to let hiro die![BRK]

But you've now shown that
you have the one trait I
prize most: integrity.[END]

=== 49 | e66e | b4 ===
[POR07]
With money, practically
anything is possible...[BRK]

But i'm pretty sure that
there's no way we can buy
hiro back from the dead.[BRK]

You've got to save him,
lucia![BRK]

[POR08]
But lemina...i...

[POR07]
Hey hey! You know what they
say: 'time is money.' And,
time's mega-a-wastin'.[BRK]

Let's make tracks for the
blue spire and wake prince
charming!
