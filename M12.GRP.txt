Ah! You've returned! I...i
don't know how to thank
you!![BRK]

All of the carnival members
have returned safely.[BRK]

And the best part is that
the thicket disappeared!
The exit is now clear![BRK]

[POR10]
That is good news, indeed![BRK]

We were successful in part
because i was able to modify
my dance steps for combat...[BRK]

...but...giban, the time
has come for me to...[BRK]

[POR00]
...!? Jean, what's the
matter?[BRK]

You seem troubled, dear...[BRK]

[POR10]
I've decided that i'm going
to leave the carnival for
a while.[BRK]

I've got to face some
problems i've been running
away from...[BRK]

I wish i could tell you 
more...just know that it's
something i must do.[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, i know your demons
haunt you.[BRK]

If the time to face them
has come, so be it![BRK]

You'll never be at peace 
until you put an end to 
what's troubling you.[BRK]

Perhaps karate master lunn
in meribia will help you
through this.[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, we've all done things
in the past that we wish we
could change.[BRK]

You've been given a chance
at redemption. I pray that
you do not waste it.[BRK]

[POR10]
I don't know what to say...[BRK]

[POR00]
Just tell me that you'll
return in one piece. [BRK]

Now get out of here...

[END]

=== 1 | 195e8 | 46 ===
[POR02]
Listen, hiro! It sounds
like music...[BRK]

What's going on over
there?

[END]

=== 2 | 19638 | 79 ===
[POR10]
Say, how did you find us?
We don't like to be
followed...[BRK]

[POR02]
Relax. We're just passing
through. Let's get going,
hiro.[END]

=== 3 | 196c8 | 206 ===
[POR10]
Hiro...hmm, that's the
strangest name i've ever
heard...[BRK]

And this is the most rag-
tag party i've ever seen...[BRK]

A weird flying creature,
a lady in a strange red
dress, and a card shark.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm not strange! Why don't
you take a look at yourself?[BRK]

[POR05]
I'll show you what i really
want to be remembered for.[BRK]

It'll just take five 
minutes...[BRK]

[POR08]
...what's wrong with my
.......dress!?[BRK]

[POR10]
Hey, relax! I wasn't making
fun of you![BRK]

I was just making an
observation...[BRK]

Anyway, you're free to 
stay with us as long as
you like.

[END]

=== 4 | 198e6 | 121 ===
[POR10]
Hiro, where are you and
your companions headed?[BRK]

What?...the holy city of
pentagulia! Are you going
to go see the goddess?[BRK]

I thought that the goddess
was just a legend...[BRK]

I wonder if she really does
exist?[BRK]

[POR08]
Why do so many people doubt
the existence of althena?[BRK]

It is so very strange...[END]

=== 5 | 19a22 | 82 ===
[POR10]
Don't be shy. You are free
to go anywhere in our little
caravan.[BRK]

We have no secrets from the
outside world. See for
yourself...[END]

=== 6 | 19ac0 | 1a9 ===
[POR10]
We were passing through this
forest, but were stopped by
the thicket over there.[BRK]

I don't think there's a way
around it.[BRK]

To make matters worse, we
have heard a terrible noise
coming from the woods.[BRK]

It sounds like a terrible
monster...perhaps the one
that made the thicket.[BRK]

Some of the performers are
getting really scared...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, great! This is the part
where she asks us to help
her...[BRK]

Just watch...i know it's
coming...[END]

=== 7 | 19c7c | 29f ===
[POR10]
If only i knew exactly where
the sounds were coming from![BRK]

Maybe then, i could find the
monster and get back the
kidnapped...[BRK]

[POR02]
What did i say!? Looks like
they need our help.[BRK]

Say, jean, the voices are
coming from the hole in the
eastern tree over there...[BRK]

[POR10]
...what hole!? I...i don't
see any hole in the tree
over there...???[BRK]

[POR02]
That's because it has a
magic spell on it. Only
we can see it.[BRK]

[POR10]
Hmmm...the magic must've
been cast to keep outsiders
from finding it.[BRK]

Show me this hole...perhaps
with your help, we can
defeat this, this...beast![BRK]

[POR02]
Of course! We should be able
to make short work of this
thing![BRK]

[POR10]
Let's go![BRK]

I will find a way to get
my friends back...[END]

=== 8 | 19f24 | 74 ===
[POR10]
Okay, ruby, show me the
way.[BRK]

[POR02]
Come on, hiro, we'd better
hurry and get that monster
before it gets anyone else![END]

=== 9 | 19fb0 | 1fb ===
[POR00]
Howdy, strangers! My name is
giban. I'm in charge of this
little caravan.[BRK]

We were on our way to the
carnival in the madoria
plains area.[BRK]

But we seem to be unable
to exit from this part
of the forest.[BRK]

We've just been stuck here
practicing for a carnival
we may never reach...[BRK]

[POR02]
Is that what jean was doing?
Practicing? It was awfully
good...[BRK]

[POR00]
Oh, you saw jean dancing?
She's the best dancer we
have.[BRK]

Whenever she creates a new
dance step, she puts on a
show for us.[BRK]

That's what she was doing
earlier...[END]

=== a | 1a1c2 | 108 ===
[POR00]
I met jean when she was a
scared and lonely young
lady.[BRK]

I've raised her as my own
daughter since she was
found.[BRK]

I think dancing is the only
thing that keeps her from
her dark secrets.[BRK]

I've grown quite attached
to the girl...don't know
what i'd do without her...[END]

=== b | 1a2de | 74 ===
[POR00]
You mark my words, jean is
going to be the best dancer
in the whole world...[BRK]

...if we all live to see
that day...[END]

=== c | 1a366 | d5 ===
[POR00]
You're going after the
monster that did this, hm?[BRK]

Jean, are you sure you're
making the right decision?[BRK]

I'd die if i lost you...[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, giban. I have to go.
If i don't, soon we'll all
be captives of this thing.[END]

=== d | 1a44a | d3 ===
[POR00]
Well, it looks like we're
ready to get out of this
forest.[BRK]

...jean, you know that you
can always come with us...[BRK]

I know, you have to take 
care of your past. Just
hurry back...[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[BRK]

Thank you, giban.[END]

=== e | 1a52c | 76 ===
Hey?! How did you get here?[BRK]

If i was you, i would go
back the way you came.[BRK]

I've got a bad feeling about
this place...[END]

=== f | 1a5b6 | eb ===
You'd better hurry and get
out of here before the noise
starts again.[BRK]

I just know it's some sort
of terrible monster...[BRK]

[POR02]
I heard those voices, too.
Come on, hiro! Let's find
a way outta this place![BRK]

[POR00]
Hopefully...it's not too
late...[END]

=== 10 | 1a6aa | 133 ===
Ohhh nooo! There it is
again! I've gotta get
outta here![BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, the sound seemed to
be coming from the enchanted
path in this tree![BRK]

But these people can't see
it because they don't have
the woodsman's spell...[BRK]

[POR05]
If that creepy sound was
coming from there,[BRK]

that monster has got to
be somewhere nearby...[END]

=== 11 | 1a7e0 | 39 ===
[POR02]
Oh no, hiro! Did you see
that? What're we gonna
do???![END]

=== 12 | 1a82c | 91 ===
Jean, thank you for saving
my life. I'm forever in your
debt.[BRK]

[POR10]
No, you're not. You should
be thanking hiro and the
others for saving your life.[END]

=== 13 | 1a8cc | d0 ===
Don't you just love our
carefree way of life?[BRK]

We have no worries. We take
life one day at a time.[BRK]

This path blockage is our
only problem.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Okay! So it's a big problem!
As if you don't have
problems![END]

=== 14 | 1a9b0 | 91 ===
Did...did you see what just
happened? Oh my god![BRK]

The ground...it just opened
up and swallowed half the
troupe![BRK]

We'll never get out of here
alive![END]

=== 15 | 1aa50 | ad ===
Yes!!! I don't know how to
thank you.[BRK]

If we hurry, we'll be able
to get to the carnival
before it's over, jean.[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sorry, but i've got
to take care of something
first...[END]

=== 16 | 1ab14 | 94 ===
'Join the carnival! Go see
the world! You'll have an
adventure!' They all said.[BRK]

Now i'm probably stuck in
these creepy woods forever![BRK]

Some life...

[END]

=== 17 | 1abc4 | 96 ===
I hate it here. This
carnival is no fun at
all.[BRK]

I knew i should've been an
undertaker...but nooooooo,[BRK]

'try the carnival,' they all
said. Ha! Some fun![END]

=== 18 | 1ac76 | 7e ===
I tell ya, if althena cared
at all about us, we wouldn't
be stuck here.[BRK]

[POR08]
Why do people blame althena
for all their problems?[END]

=== 19 | 1ad04 | 99 ===
Geez, it took you forever to
come and find me![BRK]

What were you waiting for?
The monster to eat me?[BRK]

[POR10]
You seem a bit ungrateful
for what we did, don't you?[END]

=== 1a | 1adac | d0 ===
Are you tired of those 
phony fortune-tellers?[BRK]

Then step right up! I've got
the best set of cards in the
business.[BRK]

You'll love my friendly, 
quality service.[BRK]

I'm even endorsed by a 
former star of miami vice.[END]

=== 1b | 1ae90 | f0 ===
I knew that you were going
to come and save me, jean.
I read it in the cards...[BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah, just like you foretold
that the end of the world
was coming five years ago.[BRK]

And the time when you said
that i was going to meet
a handsome stranger...
[END]

=== 1c | 1af98 | 77 ===
I've just read in the cards
that jean will be leaving
the carnival...[BRK]

And i also predict that
you will return to us...
[END]

=== 1d | 1b022 | 60 ===
Ahhh....what a beautiful
day to be alive...[BRK]

The clean, fresh air...
i think i've found paradise![END]

=== 1e | 1b09a | 53 ===
I think i'm going to skip
practice today and just take
in the beauty of this place.[END]

=== 1f | 1b0fc | 92 ===
I'm kinda depressed that you
rescued me.[BRK]

I just love the whole under-
ground cave thing. I wish I
was still there.[BRK]

[POR10]
Uh...i'm sorry...i think...?[END]

=== 20 | 1b19e | 86 ===
Of all the people i have 
taught how to dance, only 
jean has mastered the art.[BRK]

She is, without a doubt, the
best dancer in the world.[END]

=== 21 | 1b238 | 6e ===
Please! You have to find
a way to stop the terrible
monster![BRK]

Our friends...all of our
friends are just...gone![END]

=== 22 | 1b2b4 | 39 ===
[POR10]
Don't worry, we'll find some
way to get them all back![END]

=== 23 | 1b300 | 109 ===
Jean! You're still alive!![BRK]

This is great! Now everyone
will know that i'm the best
teacher in the world.[BRK]

There is nobody that can
dance, sing, and fight as
well as you.[BRK]

And i taught you![BRK]

[POR10]
I'm grateful for all that
you have shown me. You
are an excellent teacher.
[END]

=== 24 | 1b420 | d9 ===
I'm going to make sure that
everyone knows that i 
trained you, jean...[BRK]

They must know that i 
trained the best fighter 
and dancer in the world.[BRK]

[POR10]
I want to be known for my
dance, not my fighting.
Please honor that.[END]

=== 25 | 1b508 | fb ===
Just look at my totally buff
body. It drives the women
mad.[BRK]

They all want to come and 
weave their names in my 
chest hair.[BRK]

[POR05]
Pshaw! That's nothing,
sonny boy.[BRK]

I've had women tattoo my 
name all over their butts![BRK]

[POR02]
I'd tattoo hiro's name on
my butt![END]

=== 26 | 1b616 | ec ===
You can't stay away from my
beauty, can you?[BRK]

Even as darkness falls
around us and our mortal
souls are in danger...[BRK]

...still you appreciate my
smashing good looks.[BRK]

I'm glad that i could bring
some joy to your life in
this dark moment...[END]

=== 27 | 1b710 | 11 ===
[POR10]
Oh, please...
[END]

=== 28 | 1b730 | ea ===
Jean, thank you for saving
me.[BRK]

It would have been a
travesty if a body like this
were destroyed...[BRK]

Now all womankind will once
again be able to shudder at
the sight of perfection...[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm thinking i should've let
the monster eat you.[END]

=== 29 | 1b82e | 198 ===
I saw you guys talking with
jean. Please don't drag her
into any trouble![BRK]

I don't think i could live 
with myself if anything 
ever happened to her...[BRK]

I remember the first day I
saw jean...[BRK]

She looked as if she was 
dead. Her clothes were torn
and bloody...[BRK]

It was several days before
she even had the strength
to open her eyes.[BRK]

Jean has never told me what
she ran away from, but i 
know it still haunts her.[END]

=== 2a | 1b9de | 6f ===
It was rumored that jean
used to be a trained 
assassin...[BRK]

But i just can't imagine
dear jean hurting a fly...
[END]

=== 2b | 1ba60 | 48 ===
Now that the monster has
taken all our friends, what
are we going to do?[END]

=== 2c | 1babc | 78 ===
What's happened to everyone?
Jean, you aren't going to go
fight, are you?[BRK]

[POR10]
...i'll be back. I have to
save my friends![END]

=== 2d | 1bb44 | 95 ===
Jean, i've prayed for your
safe return...[BRK]

...and now you're thinking
about leaving again, i hear.[BRK]

[POR10]
I must. I can't run away
from my past forever...[END]

=== 2e | 1bbec | 64 ===
Jean and i are going to 
dance together soon at the
world finals.[BRK]

I know we'll win. Jean's
the best![END]

=== 2f | 1bc68 | b1 ===
I will admit that some-
times, i get a bit jealous
of jean's talent.[BRK]

Usually it's when people are
gaga over her and ignoring
me.[BRK]

I hate myself for it, but
hey! I'm only human...[END]

=== 30 | 1bd30 | 5d ===
Oh no, what's happening to
us?[BRK]

Goddess althena! Please save
us from the evil that is
upon us![END]

=== 31 | 1bda0 | 8a ===
Jean, is it true that you're
going to join forces with
these outsiders?[BRK]

Does giban know about this?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, so don't worry about
it, okay?[END]

=== 32 | 1be42 | 9a ===
Hey, jean, if you're leaving,
that means i'm the new head
dancer![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't get too comfortable in
your new position. I'll be 
back before you know it!



[END]

=== 33 | 1bef0 | 111 ===
Welcome to our little 
traveling carnival![BRK]

I hope that you'll be able
to stay a while and enjoy 
these pleasant surroundings.[BRK]

We're trying to find a way 
to get past that giant 
thicket up ahead.[BRK]

I hope they find a way
around this thing.[BRK]

Otherwise, i think we're
all stuck.[END]

=== 34 | 1c018 | 6a ===
I'm responsible for training
all the wild animals in this
carnival.[BRK]

Wanna see where the lion 
bit me last?[END]

=== 35 | 1c096 | 8a ===
Say, we're looking for some
new blood to join us here
in the carnival.[BRK]

[POR02]
Now that half your troupe
got sucked away, i bet you
are...




[END]

=== 36 | 1c130 | 108 ===
Thank you for saving my 
life! I thought i was going
to die down there.[BRK]

Jean, i didn't know you
could fight like that.[BRK]

Say, i'm going to work out a
new act with you and some of
the wild animals, okay?[BRK]

[POR10]
I don't think so. I won't
fight for the amusement of
others![END]

=== 37 | 1c24c | ba ===
Ke...ke...eeee
ku ke...ku...ke
ka ka...ka...ka![BRK]

[POR08]
I don't think i've ever
seen anything like this
before. What is it?[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, hello, lucia? It's a
bird. Just a dumb old bird.[BRK]

Sheesh....
[END]

=== 38 | 1c31e | b8 ===
What the hell is going on
here?![BRK]

Wiiillllbbuuurrr![BRK]

[POR08]
Ruby, it can talk! It seems
like it's frightened of
something...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh man! It looks like it's
going to freak out any 
minute now![END]

=== 39 | 1c3ea | bc ===
Don't just look at me like
that! Unhook me from these
damn wagons!![BRK]

Didn't you see what the
monster just did? We gotta
get outta here![BRK]

[POR02]
I think i liked you better
when you didn't talk...[END]

=== 3a | 1c4ba | 112 ===
Whew! That was close! At
least you pulled it off at
the last minute![BRK]

I thought we were all
dead meat back there,
wiiilllburrr![BRK]

[POR02]
Why do you keep calling me
that??!!![BRK]

[POR05]
I think it thinks it's a
horse, of course.[BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, that's ridiculous!
Where'd you ever get that
idea?[END]

=== 3b | 1c5d2 | 12 ===
Ill woods clearing[END]

=== 3c | 1e2da | 44a ===
[POR00]
Ah! You've returned! I...i
don't know how to thank
you!![BRK]

All of the carnival members
have returned safely.[BRK]

And the best part is that
the thicket disappeared!
The exit is now clear![BRK]

[POR10]
That is good news, indeed![BRK]

We were successful in part
because i was able to modify
my dance steps for combat...[BRK]

...but...giban, the time
has come for me to...[BRK]

[POR00]
...!? Jean, what's the
matter?[BRK]

You seem troubled, dear...[BRK]

[POR10]
I've decided that i'm going
to leave the carnival for
a while.[BRK]

I've got to face some
problems i've been running
away from...[BRK]

I wish i could tell you 
more...just know that it's
something i must do.[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, i know your demons
haunt you.[BRK]

If the time to face them
has come, so be it![BRK]

You'll never be at peace 
until you put an end to 
what's troubling you.[BRK]

Perhaps karate master lunn
in meribia will help you
through this.[BRK]

What's going on over

We don't like to be

Hiro...hmm, that's the
strangest name i've ever

And this is the most rag-

A weird flying creature,
a lady in a strange red
dress, and a card shark.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm not strange! Why don't
you take a look at yourself?[BRK]

[POR05]
I'll show you what i really
want to be remembered for.[BRK]

It'll just take five 
minutes...[BRK]

[POR10]
Hey, relax! I wasn't making

To make matters worse, we

It sounds like a terrible

Oh, great! This is the part

Just watch...i know it's
coming...[END]

If only i knew exactly where

Maybe then i could find the

kidnapped...[BRK]

[POR02]
What did i say!? Looks like
they need our help.[BRK]

Say jean, the voices are
coming from the hole in the
eastern tree over there...[BRK]

[POR10]
...what hole!? I...i don't
see any hole in the tree
over there....???[BRK]

That's because it has a

Howdy, strangers! My name is
giban. I'm in charge of this
little caravan.[BRK]

We were on our way to the
carnival in the madoria
plains area.[BRK]

But we seem to be unable
to exit from this part
of the forest.[BRK]

We've just been stuck here
practicing for a carnival
we may never reach...[BRK]

[POR02]
Is that what jean was doing?
Practicing? It was awfully
good...[BRK]

[POR00]
Oh, you saw jean dancing?
She's the best dancer we
have.[BRK]

Whenever she creates a new
dance step, she puts on a
show for us.[BRK]

That's what she was doing
earlier...[END]

=== 46 | 1f316 | 108 ===
[POR00]
I met jean when she was a
scared and lonely young
lady.[BRK]

I've raised her as my own
daughter since she was
found.[BRK]

I think dancing is the only
thing that keeps her from
her dark secrets.[BRK]

I've grown quite attached
to the girl...don't know
what i'd do without her...[END]

=== 47 | 1f432 | 74 ===
[POR00]
You mark my words, jean is
going to be the best dancer
in the whole world...[BRK]

...if we all live to see
that day...[END]

=== 48 | 1f4ba | d5 ===
[POR00]
You're going after the
monster that did this, hm?[BRK]

Jean, are you sure you're
making the right decision?[BRK]

I'd die if i lost you...[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, giban. I have to go.
If i don't, soon we'll all
be captives of this thing.[END]

=== 49 | 1f59e | d3 ===
[POR00]
Well, it looks like we're
ready to get out of this
forest.[BRK]

...jean, you know that you
can always come with us...[BRK]

I know, you have to take 
care of your past. Just
hurry back...[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[BRK]

Thank you, giban.[END]

=== 4a | 1f680 | 76 ===
Hey?! How did you get here?[BRK]

If i was you, i would go
back the way you came.[BRK]

I've got a bad feeling about
this place...[END]

=== 4b | 1f70a | eb ===
You'd better hurry and get
out of here before the noise
starts again.[BRK]

I just know it's some sort
of terrible monster...[BRK]

[POR02]
I heard those voices, too.
Come on, hiro! Let's find
a way outta this place![BRK]

[POR00]
Hopefully...it's not too
late...[END]

=== 4c | 1f7fe | 133 ===
Ohhh nooo! There it is
again! I've gotta get
outta here![BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, the sound seemed to
be coming from the enchanted
path in this tree![BRK]

But these people can't see
it because they don't have
the woodsman's spell...[BRK]

[POR05]
If that creepy sound was
coming from there,[BRK]

that monster has got to
be somewhere nearby...[END]

=== 4d | 1f934 | 39 ===
[POR02]
Oh no, hiro! Did you see
that? What're we gonna
do???![END]

=== 4e | 1f980 | 91 ===
Jean, thank you for saving
my life. I'm forever in your
debt.[BRK]

[POR10]
No, you're not. You should
be thanking hiro and the
others for saving your life.[END]

=== 4f | 1fa20 | d0 ===
Don't you just love our
carefree way of life?[BRK]

We have no worries. We take
life one day at a time.[BRK]

This path blockage is our
only problem.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Okay! So it's a big problem!
As if you don't have
problems![END]

=== 50 | 1fb04 | 91 ===
Did...did you see what just
happened? Oh my god![BRK]

The ground...it just opened
up and swallowed half the
troupe![BRK]

We'll never get out of here
alive![END]

=== 51 | 1fba4 | ad ===
Yes!!! I don't know how to
thank you.[BRK]

If we hurry, we'll be able
to get to the carnival
before it's over, jean.[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sorry, but i've got
to take care of something
first...[END]

=== 52 | 1fc68 | 94 ===
'Join the carnival! Go see
the world! You'll have an
adventure!' They all said.[BRK]

Now i'm probably stuck in
these creepy woods forever![BRK]

Some life...

[END]

=== 53 | 1fd18 | 96 ===
I hate it here. This
carnival is no fun at
all.[BRK]

I knew i should've been an
undertaker...but nooooooo,[BRK]

'try the carnival,' they all
said. Ha! Some fun![END]

=== 54 | 1fdca | 7e ===
I tell ya, if althena cared
at all about us, we wouldn't
be stuck here.[BRK]

[POR08]
Why do people blame althena
for all their problems?[END]

=== 55 | 1fe58 | 99 ===
Geez, it took you forever to
come and find me![BRK]

What were you waiting for?
The monster to eat me?[BRK]

[POR10]
You seem a bit ungrateful
for what we did, don't you?[END]

=== 56 | 1ff00 | d0 ===
Are you tired of those 
phony fortune-tellers?[BRK]

Then step right up! I've got
the best set of cards in the
business.[BRK]

You'll love my friendly, 
quality service.[BRK]

I'm even endorsed by a 
former star of miami vice.[END]

=== 57 | 1ffe4 | f0 ===
I knew that you were going
to come and save me, jean.
I read it in the cards...[BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah, just like you foretold
that the end of the world
was coming five years ago.[BRK]

And the time when you said
that i was going to meet
a handsome stranger...
[END]

=== 58 | 200ec | 77 ===
I've just read in the cards
that jean will be leaving
the carnival...[BRK]

And i also predict that
you will return to us...
[END]

=== 59 | 20176 | 60 ===
Ahhh....what a beautiful
day to be alive...[BRK]

The clean, fresh air...
i think i've found paradise![END]

=== 5a | 201ee | 53 ===
I think i'm going to skip
practice today and just take
in the beauty of this place.[END]

=== 5b | 20250 | 92 ===
I'm kinda depressed that you
rescued me.[BRK]

I just love the whole under-
ground cave thing. I wish I
was still there.[BRK]

[POR10]
Uh...i'm sorry...i think...?[END]

=== 5c | 202f2 | 86 ===
Of all the people i have 
taught how to dance, only 
jean has mastered the art.[BRK]

She is, without a doubt, the
best dancer in the world.[END]

=== 5d | 2038c | 6e ===
Please! You have to find
a way to stop the terrible
monster![BRK]

Our friends...all of our
friends are just...gone![END]

=== 5e | 20408 | 39 ===
[POR10]
Don't worry, we'll find some
way to get them all back![END]

=== 5f | 20454 | 109 ===
Jean! You're still alive!![BRK]

This is great! Now everyone
will know that i'm the best
teacher in the world.[BRK]

There is nobody that can
dance, sing, and fight as
well as you.[BRK]

And i taught you![BRK]

[POR10]
I'm grateful for all that
you have shown me. You
are an excellent teacher.
[END]

=== 60 | 20574 | d9 ===
I'm going to make sure that
everyone knows that i 
trained you, jean...[BRK]

They must know that i 
trained the best fighter 
and dancer in the world.[BRK]

[POR10]
I want to be known for my
dance, not my fighting.
Please honor that.[END]

=== 61 | 2065c | fb ===
Just look at my totally buff
body. It drives the women
mad.[BRK]

They all want to come and 
weave their names in my 
chest hair.[BRK]

[POR05]
Pshaw! That's nothing,
sonny boy.[BRK]

I've had women tattoo my 
name all over their butts![BRK]

[POR02]
I'd tattoo hiro's name on
my butt![END]

=== 62 | 2076a | ec ===
You can't stay away from my
beauty, can you?[BRK]

Even as darkness falls
around us and our mortal
souls are in danger...[BRK]

...still you appreciate my
smashing good looks.[BRK]

I'm glad that i could bring
some joy to your life in
this dark moment...[END]

=== 63 | 20864 | 11 ===
[POR10]
Oh, please...
[END]

=== 64 | 20884 | ea ===
Jean, thank you for saving
me.[BRK]

It would have been a
travesty if a body like this
were destroyed...[BRK]

Now all womankind will once
again be able to shudder at
the sight of perfection...[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm thinking i should've let
the monster eat you.[END]

=== 65 | 20982 | 198 ===
I saw you guys talking with
jean. Please don't drag her
into any trouble![BRK]

I don't think i could live 
with myself if anything 
ever happened to her...[BRK]

I remember the first day I
saw jean...[BRK]

She looked as if she was 
dead. Her clothes were torn
and bloody...[BRK]

It was several days before
she even had the strength
to open her eyes.[BRK]

Jean has never told me what
she ran away from, but i 
know it still haunts her.[END]

=== 66 | 20b32 | 6f ===
It was rumored that jean
used to be a trained 
assassin...[BRK]

But i just can't imagine
dear jean hurting a fly...
[END]

=== 67 | 20bb4 | 48 ===
Now that the monster has
taken all our friends, what
are we going to do?[END]

=== 68 | 20c10 | 78 ===
What's happened to everyone?
Jean, you aren't going to go
fight, are you?[BRK]

[POR10]
...i'll be back. I have to
save my friends![END]

=== 69 | 20c98 | 95 ===
Jean, i've prayed for your
safe return...[BRK]

...and now you're thinking
about leaving again, i hear.[BRK]

[POR10]
I must. I can't run away
from my past forever...[END]

=== 6a | 20d40 | 64 ===
Jean and i are going to 
dance together soon at the
world finals.[BRK]

I know we'll win. Jean's
the best![END]

=== 6b | 20dbc | b1 ===
I will admit that some-
times, i get a bit jealous
of jean's talent.[BRK]

Usually it's when people are
gaga over her and ignoring
me.[BRK]

I hate myself for it, but
hey! I'm only human...[END]

=== 6c | 20e84 | 5d ===
Oh no, what's happening to
us?[BRK]

Goddess althena! Please save
us from the evil that is
upon us![END]

=== 6d | 20ef4 | 8a ===
Jean, is it true that you're
going to join forces with
these outsiders?[BRK]

Does giban know about this?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, so don't worry about
it, okay?[END]

=== 6e | 20f96 | 9a ===
Hey, jean, if you're leaving,
that means i'm the new head
dancer![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't get too comfortable in
your new position. I'll be 
back before you know it!



[END]

=== 6f | 21044 | 111 ===
Welcome to our little 
traveling carnival![BRK]

I hope that you'll be able
to stay a while and enjoy 
these pleasant surroundings.[BRK]

We're trying to find a way 
to get past that giant 
thicket up ahead.[BRK]

I hope they find a way
around this thing.[BRK]

Otherwise, i think we're
all stuck.[END]

=== 70 | 2116c | 6a ===
I'm responsible for training
all the wild animals in this
carnival.[BRK]

Wanna see where the lion 
bit me last?[END]

=== 71 | 211ea | 8a ===
Say, we're looking for some
new blood to join us here
in the carnival.[BRK]

[POR02]
Now that half your troupe
got sucked away, i bet you
are...




[END]

=== 72 | 21284 | 108 ===
Thank you for saving my 
life! I thought i was going
to die down there.[BRK]

Jean, i didn't know you
could fight like that.[BRK]

Say, i'm going to work out a
new act with you and some of
the wild animals, okay?[BRK]

[POR10]
I don't think so. I won't
fight for the amusement of
others![END]

=== 73 | 213a0 | ba ===
Ke...ke...eeee
ku ke...ku...ke
ka ka...ka...ka![BRK]

[POR08]
I don't think i've ever
seen anything like this
before. What is it?[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, hello, lucia? It's a
bird. Just a dumb old bird.[BRK]

Sheesh....
[END]

=== 74 | 21472 | b8 ===
What the hell is going on
here?![BRK]

Wiiillllbbuuurrr![BRK]

[POR08]
Ruby, it can talk! It seems
like it's frightened of
something...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh man! It looks like it's
going to freak out any 
minute now![END]

=== 75 | 2153e | bc ===
Don't just look at me like
that! Unhook me from these
damn wagons!![BRK]

Didn't you see what the
monster just did? We gotta
get outta here![BRK]

[POR02]
I think i liked you better
when you didn't talk...[END]

=== 76 | 2160e | 112 ===
Whew! That was close! At
least you pulled it off at
the last minute![BRK]

I thought we were all
dead meat back there,
wiiilllburrr![BRK]

[POR02]
Why do you keep calling me
that??!!![BRK]

[POR05]
I think it thinks it's a
horse, of course.[BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, that's ridiculous!
Where'd you ever get that
idea?[END]

=== 77 | 21726 | 12 ===
Ill woods clearing[END]

=== 78 | 233f8 | 44a ===
[POR00]
Ah! You've returned! I...i
don't know how to thank
you!![BRK]

All of the carnival members
have returned safely.[BRK]

And the best part is that
the thicket disappeared!
The exit is now clear![BRK]

[POR10]
That is good news, indeed![BRK]

We were successful in part
because i was able to modify
my dance steps for combat...[BRK]

...but...giban, the time
has come for me to...[BRK]

[POR00]
...!? Jean, what's the
matter?[BRK]

You seem troubled, dear...[BRK]

[POR10]
I've decided that i'm going
to leave the carnival for
a while.[BRK]

I've got to face some
problems i've been running
away from...[BRK]

I wish i could tell you 
more...just know that it's
something i must do.[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, i know your demons
haunt you.[BRK]

If the time to face them
has come, so be it![BRK]

You'll never be at peace 
until you put an end to 
what's troubling you.[BRK]

Perhaps karate master lunn
in meribia will help you
through this.[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, we've all done things
in the past that we wish we
could change.[BRK]

You've been given a chance
at redemption. I pray that
you do not waste it.[BRK]

[POR10]
I don't know what to say...[BRK]

[POR00]
Just tell me that you'll
return in one piece. [BRK]

Now get out of here...

[END]

=== 79 | 2385a | 46 ===
[POR02]
...listen, hiro! It sounds
like music.[BRK]

What's going on over
there?
[END]

=== 7a | 238aa | 79 ===
[POR10]
Say, how did you find us?
We don't like to be
followed...[BRK]

[POR02]
Relax, we're just passing
through. Let's get going,
hiro.[END]

=== 7b | 2393a | 206 ===
[POR10]
Hiro...hmm, that's the
strangest name i've ever
heard...[BRK]

And this is the most rag-
tag party i've ever seen...[BRK]

A weird flying creature,
a lady in a strange red
dress, and a card shark.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm not strange! Why don't
you take a look at yourself?[BRK]

[POR05]
I'll show you what i really
want to be remembered for.[BRK]

It'll just take five 
minutes...[BRK]

[POR08]
...what's wrong with my
.......dress!?[BRK]

[POR10]
Hey, relax! I wasn't making
fun of you![BRK]

I was just making an
observation....[BRK]

Anyway, you're free to 
stay with us as long as
you like.
[END]

=== 7c | 23b58 | 121 ===
[POR10]
Hiro, where are you and
your companions headed?[BRK]

What?...the holy city of
pentagulia! Are you going
to go see the goddess?[BRK]

I thought that the goddess
was just a legend...[BRK]

I wonder if she really does
exist?[BRK]

[POR08]
Why do so many people doubt
the existence of althena?[BRK]

It is so very strange...[END]

=== 7d | 23c94 | 82 ===
[POR10]
Don't be shy. You are free
to go anywhere in our little
caravan.[BRK]

We have no secrets from the
outside world. See for
yourself...[END]

=== 7e | 23d32 | 1a9 ===
[POR10]
We were passing through this
forest, but were stopped by
the thicket over there.[BRK]

I don't think there's a way
around it.[BRK]

To make matters worse, we
have heard a terrible noise
coming from the woods.[BRK]

It sounds like a terrible
monster...perhaps the one
that made the thicket.[BRK]

Some of the performers are
getting really scared...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, great! This is the part
where she asks us to help
her...[BRK]

Just watch...i know it's
coming...[END]

=== 7f | 23eee | 29f ===
[POR10]
If only i knew exactly where
the sounds were coming from![BRK]

Maybe then, i could find the
monster and get back the
kidnapped...[BRK]

[POR02]
What did i say!? Looks like
they need our help.[BRK]

Say, jean, the voices are
coming from the hole in the
eastern tree over there...[BRK]

[POR10]
...what hole!? I...i don't
see any hole in the tree
over there...???[BRK]

[POR02]
That's because it has a
magic spell on it. Only
we can see it.[BRK]

[POR10]
Hmmm...the magic must've
been cast to keep outsiders
from finding it.[BRK]

Show me this hole...perhaps
with your help, we can
defeat this, this...beast![BRK]

[POR02]
Of course! We should be able
to make short work of this
thing![BRK]

[POR10]
Let's go![BRK]

I will find a way to get
my friends back...[END]

=== 80 | 24196 | 74 ===
[POR10]
Okay, ruby, show me the
way.[BRK]

[POR02]
Come on, hiro, we'd better
hurry and get that monster
before it gets anyone else![END]

Are you tired of those 
phony fortune-tellers?[BRK]

Then step right up! I've got
the best set of cards in the

You'll love my friendly,

I'm even endorsed by a 
former star of miami vice.[END]

I knew that you were going
to come and save me, jean.
I read it in the cards...[BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah, just like you foretold
that the end of the world
was coming five years ago.[BRK]

And the time when you said
that i was going to meet
a handsome stranger...
[END]

I've just read in the cards

the carnival...[BRK]

And i also predict that
you will return to us...

Ahhh...what a beautiful
day to be alive...[BRK]

The clean, fresh air...
i think i've found paradise!

I think i'm going to skip
practice today and just take

I'm kinda depressed that you
rescued me.[BRK]

I just love the whole under-
ground cave thing. I wish I
was still there.[BRK]

[POR10]
Uh...i'm sorry...i think...?[END]

=== 98 | 25410 | 86 ===
Of all the people i have 
taught how to dance, only 
jean has mastered the art.[BRK]

She is, without a doubt, the
best dancer in the world.[END]

Please! You have to find
a way to stop the terrible
monster![BRK]

Our friends...all of our

Don't worry, we'll find some

Jean! You're still alive!![BRK]

This is great! Now everyone
will know that i'm the best
teacher in the world.[BRK]

There is nobody that can
dance, sing, and fight as
well as you.[BRK]

And i taught you![BRK]

[POR10]
I'm grateful for all that
you have shown me. You
are an excellent teacher.
[END]

=== 9c | 25692 | d9 ===
I'm going to make sure that
everyone knows that i 
trained you, jean...[BRK]

They must know that i 
trained the best fighter

[POR10]
I want to be known for my
dance, not my fighting.
Please honor that.[END]

Just look at my totally buff
body. It drives the women
mad.[BRK]

They all want to come and 
weave their names in my 
chest hair.[BRK]

[POR05]
Pshaw! That's nothing,
sonny boy.[BRK]

I've had women tattoo my 
name all over their butts![BRK]

I'd tattoo hiro's name on
my butt![END]

You can't stay away from my

Even as darkness falls

smashing good looks.[BRK]

I'm glad that i could bring
some joy to your life in
this dark moment...[END]

Jean, thank you for saving

It would have been a
travesty if a body like this
were destroyed...[BRK]

Now all womankind will once
again be able to shudder at
the sight of perfection...[BRK]

I'm thinking i should've let
the monster eat you.[END]

I saw you guys talking with
jean. Please don't drag her
into any trouble![BRK]

I don't think i could live 
with myself if anything 
ever happened to her...[BRK]

I remember the first day I
saw jean...[BRK]

She looked as if she was 
dead. Her clothes were torn
and bloody...[BRK]

It was several days before
she even had the strength
to open her eyes.[BRK]

Jean has never told me what
she ran away from, but i 
know it still haunts her.[END]

It was rumored that jean
used to be a trained 
assassin...[BRK]

But i just can't imagine
dear jean hurting a fly...

Now that the monster has
taken all our friends, what

Jean, you aren't going to go
fight, are you?[BRK]

[POR10]
...i'll be back. I have to
save my friends![END]

=== a5 | 25db6 | 95 ===
Jean, i've prayed for your
safe return...[BRK]

about leaving again, i hear.[BRK]

[POR10]
I must. I can't run away
from my past forever...[END]

Jean and i are going to 
dance together soon at the
world finals.[BRK]

I know we'll win. Jean's
the best![END]

I will admit that some-
times, i get a bit jealous
of jean's talent.[BRK]

Usually it's when people are
gaga over her and ignoring
me.[BRK]

I hate myself for it, but
hey! I'm only human...[END]

=== a8 | 25fa2 | 5d ===
Oh no, what's happening to
us?[BRK]

Goddess althena! Please save
us from the evil that is
upon us![END]

Jean, is it true that you're
going to join forces with
these outsiders?[BRK]

Does giban know about this?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, so don't worry about
it, okay?[END]

=== aa | 260b4 | 9a ===
Hey, jean, if you're leaving,
that means i'm the new head

Don't get too comfortable in

Jean, i didn't know you
could fight like that.[BRK]

the wild animals, okay?[BRK]

I don't think so. I won't

used to be a karate master![BRK]

Okay, so she's not my real
sister, but we were raised
together.[BRK]

One day, i want to grow up
to be a strong karate
fighter![BRK]

I've asked jean to teach me
karate, but she always gets
sad when i mention it.[BRK]

I wish i knew why she did
that...[END]

i need to use karate.[END]

Jean...you're going to leave
us, aren't you? Please don't
go![BRK]

I-i need you to stay so you
can teach me karate![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't worry, little brother.
I'll be back soon to teach
you what you need to know.[BRK]

But i won't teach you the
aggressive karate of death,
only the defensive moves.[BRK]

That's all you need to know
to become a strong defender
of our troupe.

That jean! Always pretending
no one notices her![BRK]

Before she came, i was the
best dancer in our caravan![BRK]

Then, we had to go and
rescue that stupid girl![BRK]

When we found her she was
just a poor urchin in torn
karate rags![BRK]

Hah! I wish she had never
joined us. Then i would
still be the best![END]

Oh! That's so good to hear
from you! I never wanted to
be rivals anyway.[BRK]

From now on, we're nothing

Ever since i first saw your

I don't care that your past

can live with your sins.[BRK]

I want to be with you, to
hold you...to, to...rub warm
goat's milk on your...[BRK]

Whew! Is it getting hot in

hotter in here...[BRK]

You know, i think this jean

Warned? Why? Why would you
have to warn jean of the
depth of my love?[END]

If i didn't have diarrhea,

my brave skill![BRK]

[POR02]
Um, yeah...right. Diarrhea.
You should try anyway.[BRK]

Maybe you could immobilize
the monster like one of
those sticky-foam guns.[BRK]

It could be your secret
weapon.[BRK]

Hehe...or better yet...your
stinky weapon...[END]

in his shrine![BRK]

'Welcome to the jungle, we
got weeds to tame...[BRK]

If they stoke your allergies
well, it's the price you
pay.'[BRK]

But i keep trying. Someday
i hope to dance in one of

Why do they dance at these

Did althena tell them to?

I've got it all worked out
