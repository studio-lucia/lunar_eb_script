Ah! You've returned! I...I
don't know how to thank
you!![BRK]

All of the carnival members
have returned safely.[BRK]

And the best part is that
the thicket disappeared!
The exit is now clear![BRK]

[POR10]
That is good news, indeed![BRK]

We were successful in part
because I was able to modify
my dance steps for combat...[BRK]

...But...Giban, the time
has come for me to...[BRK]

[POR00]
...!? Jean, what's the
matter?[BRK]

You seem troubled, dear...[BRK]

[POR10]
I've decided that I'm going
to leave the carnival for
a while.[BRK]

I've got to face some
problems I've been running
away from...[BRK]

I wish I could tell you 
more...Just know that it's
something I must do.[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, I know your demons
haunt you.[BRK]

If the time to face them
has come, so be it![BRK]

You'll never be at peace 
until you put an end to 
what's troubling you.[BRK]

Perhaps Karate Master Lunn
in Meribia will help you
through this.[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, we've all done things
in the past that we wish we
could change.[BRK]

You've been given a chance
at redemption. I pray that
you do not waste it.[BRK]

[POR10]
I don't know what to say...[BRK]

[POR00]
Just tell me that you'll
return in one piece. [BRK]

Now get out of here...[END]

=== 1 | 195e8 | 46 ===
[POR02]
Listen, Hiro! It sounds
like music...[BRK]

What's going on over
there?[END]

=== 2 | 19638 | 79 ===
[POR10]
Say, how did you find us?
We don't like to be
followed...[BRK]

[POR02]
Relax. We're just passing
through. Let's get going,
Hiro.[END]

=== 3 | 196c8 | 206 ===
[POR10]
Hiro...Hmm, that's the
strangest name I've ever
heard...[BRK]

And this is the most rag-
tag party I've ever seen...[BRK]

A weird flying creature,
a lady in a strange red
dress, and a card shark.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm not strange! Why don't
you take a look at yourself?[BRK]

[POR05]
I'll show you what I really
want to be remembered for.[BRK]

It'll just take five 
minutes...[BRK]

[POR08]
...What's wrong with my
.......dress!?[BRK]

[POR10]
Hey, relax! I wasn't making
fun of you![BRK]

I was just making an
observation...[BRK]

Anyway, you're free to 
stay with us as long as
you like.[END]

=== 4 | 198e6 | 121 ===
[POR10]
Hiro, where are you and
your companions headed?[BRK]

What?...The Holy City of
Pentagulia! Are you going
to go see the Goddess?[BRK]

I thought that the Goddess
was just a legend...[BRK]

I wonder if she really does
exist?[BRK]

[POR08]
Why do so many people doubt
the existence of Althena?[BRK]

It is so very strange...[END]

=== 5 | 19a22 | 82 ===
[POR10]
Don't be shy. You are free
to go anywhere in our little
caravan.[BRK]

We have no secrets from the
outside world. See for
yourself...[END]

=== 6 | 19ac0 | 1a9 ===
[POR10]
We were passing through this
forest, but were stopped by
the thicket over there.[BRK]

I don't think there's a way
around it.[BRK]

To make matters worse, we
have heard a terrible noise
coming from the woods.[BRK]

It sounds like a terrible
monster...perhaps the one
that made the thicket.[BRK]

Some of the performers are
getting really scared...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, great! This is the part
where she asks us to help
her...[BRK]

Just watch...I know it's
coming...[END]

=== 7 | 19c7c | 29f ===
[POR10]
If only I knew exactly where
the sounds were coming from![BRK]

Maybe then, I could find the
monster and get back the
kidnapped...[BRK]

[POR02]
What did I say!? Looks like
they need our help.[BRK]

Say, Jean, the voices are
coming from the hole in the
eastern tree over there...[BRK]

[POR10]
...What hole!? I...I don't
see any hole in the tree
over there...???[BRK]

[POR02]
That's because it has a
magic spell on it. Only
we can see it.[BRK]

[POR10]
Hmmm...the magic must've
been cast to keep outsiders
from finding it.[BRK]

Show me this hole...Perhaps
with your help, we can
defeat this, this...beast![BRK]

[POR02]
Of course! We should be able
to make short work of this
thing![BRK]

[POR10]
Let's go![BRK]

I will find a way to get
my friends back...[END]

=== 8 | 19f24 | 74 ===
[POR10]
Okay, Ruby, show me the
way.[BRK]

[POR02]
Come on, Hiro, we'd better
hurry and get that monster
before it gets anyone else![END]

=== 9 | 19fb0 | 1fb ===
[POR00]
Howdy, strangers! My name is
Giban. I'm in charge of this
little caravan.[BRK]

We were on our way to the
carnival in the Madoria
Plains area.[BRK]

But we seem to be unable
to exit from this part
of the forest.[BRK]

We've just been stuck here
practicing for a carnival
we may never reach...[BRK]

[POR02]
Is that what Jean was doing?
Practicing? It was awfully
good...[BRK]

[POR00]
Oh, you saw Jean dancing?
She's the best dancer we
have.[BRK]

Whenever she creates a new
dance step, she puts on a
show for us.[BRK]

That's what she was doing
earlier...[END]

=== a | 1a1c2 | 108 ===
[POR00]
I met Jean when she was a
scared and lonely young
lady.[BRK]

I've raised her as my own
daughter since she was
found.[BRK]

I think dancing is the only
thing that keeps her from
her dark secrets.[BRK]

I've grown quite attached
to the girl...Don't know
what I'd do without her...[END]

=== b | 1a2de | 74 ===
[POR00]
You mark my words, Jean is
going to be the best dancer
in the whole world...[BRK]

...If we all live to see
that day...[END]

=== c | 1a366 | d5 ===
[POR00]
You're going after the
monster that did this, hm?[BRK]

Jean, are you sure you're
making the right decision?[BRK]

I'd die if I lost you...[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, Giban. I have to go.
If I don't, soon we'll all
be captives of this thing.[END]

=== d | 1a44a | d3 ===
[POR00]
Well, it looks like we're
ready to get out of this
forest.[BRK]

...Jean, you know that you
can always come with us...[BRK]

I know, you have to take 
care of your past. Just
hurry back...[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[BRK]

Thank you, Giban.[END]

=== e | 1a52c | 76 ===
Hey?! How did you get here?[BRK]

If I was you, I would go
back the way you came.[BRK]

I've got a bad feeling about
this place...[END]

=== f | 1a5b6 | eb ===
You'd better hurry and get
out of here before the noise
starts again.[BRK]

I just know it's some sort
of terrible monster...[BRK]

[POR02]
I heard those voices, too.
Come on, Hiro! Let's find
a way outta this place![BRK]

[POR00]
Hopefully...it's not too
late...[END]

=== 10 | 1a6aa | 133 ===
Ohhh nooo! There it is
again! I've gotta get
outta here![BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, the sound seemed to
be coming from the enchanted
path in this tree![BRK]

But these people can't see
it because they don't have
the woodsman's spell...[BRK]

[POR05]
If that creepy sound was
coming from there,[BRK]

that monster has got to
be somewhere nearby...[END]

=== 11 | 1a7e0 | 39 ===
[POR02]
Oh no, Hiro! Did you see
that? What're we gonna
do???![END]

=== 12 | 1a82c | 91 ===
Jean, thank you for saving
my life. I'm forever in your
debt.[BRK]

[POR10]
No, you're not. You should
be thanking Hiro and the
others for saving your life.[END]

=== 13 | 1a8cc | d0 ===
Don't you just love our
carefree way of life?[BRK]

We have no worries. We take
life one day at a time.[BRK]

This path blockage is our
only problem.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Okay! So it's a big problem!
As if you don't have
problems![END]

=== 14 | 1a9b0 | 91 ===
Did...Did you see what just
happened? Oh my god![BRK]

The ground...It just opened
up and swallowed half the
troupe![BRK]

We'll never get out of here
alive![END]

=== 15 | 1aa50 | ad ===
Yes!!! I don't know how to
thank you.[BRK]

If we hurry, we'll be able
to get to the carnival
before it's over, Jean.[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sorry, but I've got
to take care of something
first...[END]

=== 16 | 1ab14 | 94 ===
'Join the carnival! Go see
the world! You'll have an
adventure!' they all said.[BRK]

Now I'm probably stuck in
these creepy woods forever![BRK]

Some life...[END]

=== 17 | 1abc4 | 96 ===
I hate it here. This
carnival is no fun at
all.[BRK]

I knew I should've been an
undertaker...but nooooooo,[BRK]

'Try the carnival,' they all
said. Ha! Some fun![END]

=== 18 | 1ac76 | 7e ===
I tell ya, if Althena cared
at all about us, we wouldn't
be stuck here.[BRK]

[POR08]
Why do people blame Althena
for all their problems?[END]

=== 19 | 1ad04 | 99 ===
Geez, it took you forever to
come and find me![BRK]

What were you waiting for?
The monster to eat me?[BRK]

[POR10]
You seem a bit ungrateful
for what we did, don't you?[END]

=== 1a | 1adac | d0 ===
Are you tired of those 
phony fortune-tellers?[BRK]

Then step right up! I've got
the best set of cards in the
business.[BRK]

You'll love my friendly, 
quality service.[BRK]

I'm even endorsed by a 
former star of Miami Vice.[END]

=== 1b | 1ae90 | f0 ===
I knew that you were going
to come and save me, Jean.
I read it in the cards...[BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah, just like you foretold
that the end of the world
was coming five years ago.[BRK]

And the time when you said
that I was going to meet
a handsome stranger...[END]

=== 1c | 1af98 | 77 ===
I've just read in the cards
that Jean will be leaving
the carnival...[BRK]

And I also predict that
you will return to us...[END]

=== 1d | 1b022 | 60 ===
Ahhh....What a beautiful
day to be alive...[BRK]

The clean, fresh air...
I think I've found paradise![END]

=== 1e | 1b09a | 53 ===
I think I'm going to skip
practice today and just take
in the beauty of this place.[END]

=== 1f | 1b0fc | 92 ===
I'm kinda depressed that you
rescued me.[BRK]

I just love the whole under-
ground cave thing. I wish I
was still there.[BRK]

[POR10]
Uh...I'm sorry...I think...?[END]

=== 20 | 1b19e | 86 ===
Of all the people I have 
taught how to dance, only 
Jean has mastered the art.[BRK]

She is, without a doubt, the
best dancer in the world.[END]

=== 21 | 1b238 | 6e ===
Please! You have to find
a way to stop the terrible
monster![BRK]

Our friends...all of our
friends are just...gone![END]

=== 22 | 1b2b4 | 39 ===
[POR10]
Don't worry, we'll find some
way to get them all back![END]

=== 23 | 1b300 | 109 ===
Jean! You're still alive!![BRK]

This is great! Now everyone
will know that I'm the best
teacher in the world.[BRK]

There is nobody that can
dance, sing, and fight as
well as you.[BRK]

And I taught you![BRK]

[POR10]
I'm grateful for all that
you have shown me. You
are an excellent teacher.[END]

=== 24 | 1b420 | d9 ===
I'm going to make sure that
everyone knows that I 
trained you, Jean...[BRK]

They must know that I 
trained the best fighter 
and dancer in the world.[BRK]

[POR10]
I want to be known for my
dance, not my fighting.
Please honor that.[END]

=== 25 | 1b508 | fb ===
Just look at my totally buff
body. It drives the women
mad.[BRK]

They all want to come and 
weave their names in my 
chest hair.[BRK]

[POR05]
Pshaw! That's nothing,
sonny boy.[BRK]

I've had women tattoo my 
name all over their butts![BRK]

[POR02]
I'd tattoo Hiro's name on
my butt![END]

=== 26 | 1b616 | ec ===
You can't stay away from my
beauty, can you?[BRK]

Even as darkness falls
around us and our mortal
souls are in danger...[BRK]

...still you appreciate my
smashing good looks.[BRK]

I'm glad that I could bring
some joy to your life in
this dark moment...[END]

=== 27 | 1b710 | 11 ===
[POR10]
Oh, please...[END]

=== 28 | 1b730 | ea ===
Jean, thank you for saving
me.[BRK]

It would have been a
travesty if a body like this
were destroyed...[BRK]

Now all womankind will once
again be able to shudder at
the sight of perfection...[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm thinking I should've let
the monster eat you.[END]

=== 29 | 1b82e | 198 ===
I saw you guys talking with
Jean. Please don't drag her
into any trouble![BRK]

I don't think I could live 
with myself if anything 
ever happened to her...[BRK]

I remember the first day I
saw Jean...[BRK]

She looked as if she was 
dead. Her clothes were torn
and bloody...[BRK]

It was several days before
she even had the strength
to open her eyes.[BRK]

Jean has never told me what
she ran away from, but I 
know it still haunts her.[END]

=== 2a | 1b9de | 6f ===
It was rumored that Jean
used to be a trained 
assassin...[BRK]

But I just can't imagine
dear Jean hurting a fly...[END]

=== 2b | 1ba60 | 48 ===
Now that the monster has
taken all our friends, what
are we going to do?[END]

=== 2c | 1babc | 78 ===
What's happened to everyone?
Jean, you aren't going to go
fight, are you?[BRK]

[POR10]
...I'll be back. I have to
save my friends![END]

=== 2d | 1bb44 | 95 ===
Jean, I've prayed for your
safe return...[BRK]

...and now you're thinking
about leaving again, I hear.[BRK]

[POR10]
I must. I can't run away
from my past forever...[END]

=== 2e | 1bbec | 64 ===
Jean and I are going to 
dance together soon at the
world finals.[BRK]

I know we'll win. Jean's
the best![END]

=== 2f | 1bc68 | b1 ===
I will admit that some-
times, I get a bit jealous
of Jean's talent.[BRK]

Usually it's when people are
gaga over her and ignoring
me.[BRK]

I hate myself for it, but
hey! I'm only human...[END]

=== 30 | 1bd30 | 5d ===
Oh no, what's happening to
us?[BRK]

Goddess Althena! Please save
us from the evil that is
upon us![END]

=== 31 | 1bda0 | 8a ===
Jean, is it true that you're
going to join forces with
these outsiders?[BRK]

Does Giban know about this?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, so don't worry about
it, okay?[END]

=== 32 | 1be42 | 9a ===
Hey, Jean, if you're leaving,
that means I'm the new head
dancer![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't get too comfortable in
your new position. I'll be 
back before you know it![END]

=== 33 | 1bef0 | 111 ===
Welcome to our little 
traveling carnival![BRK]

I hope that you'll be able
to stay a while and enjoy 
these pleasant surroundings.[BRK]

We're trying to find a way 
to get past that giant 
thicket up ahead.[BRK]

I hope they find a way
around this thing.[BRK]

Otherwise, I think we're
all stuck.[END]

=== 34 | 1c018 | 6a ===
I'm responsible for training
all the wild animals in this
carnival.[BRK]

Wanna see where the lion 
bit me last?[END]

=== 35 | 1c096 | 8a ===
Say, we're looking for some
new blood to join us here
in the carnival.[BRK]

[POR02]
Now that half your troupe
got sucked away, I bet you
are...[END]

=== 36 | 1c130 | 108 ===
Thank you for saving my 
life! I thought I was going
to die down there.[BRK]

Jean, I didn't know you
could fight like that.[BRK]

Say, I'm going to work out a
new act with you and some of
the wild animals, okay?[BRK]

[POR10]
I don't think so. I won't
fight for the amusement of
others![END]

=== 37 | 1c24c | ba ===
Ke...ke...eeee
Ku ke...ku...ke
Ka ka...ka...ka![BRK]

[POR08]
I don't think I've ever
seen anything like this
before. What is it?[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, hello, Lucia? It's a
bird. Just a dumb old bird.[BRK]

Sheesh....[END]

=== 38 | 1c31e | b8 ===
What the hell is going on
here?![BRK]

Wiiillllbbuuurrr![BRK]

[POR08]
Ruby, it can talk! It seems
like it's frightened of
something...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh man! It looks like it's
going to freak out any 
minute now![END]

=== 39 | 1c3ea | bc ===
Don't just look at me like
that! Unhook me from these
damn wagons!![BRK]

Didn't you see what the
monster just did? We gotta
get outta here![BRK]

[POR02]
I think I liked you better
when you didn't talk...[END]

=== 3a | 1c4ba | 112 ===
Whew! That was close! At
least you pulled it off at
the last minute![BRK]

I thought we were all
dead meat back there,
Wiiilllburrr![BRK]

[POR02]
Why do you keep calling me
that??!!![BRK]

[POR05]
I think it thinks it's a
horse, of course.[BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, that's ridiculous!
Where'd you ever get that
idea?[END]

=== 3b | 1c5d2 | 12 ===
Ill Woods Clearing[END]

=== 3c | 1e2da | 44a ===
[POR00]
Ah! You've returned! I...I
don't know how to thank
you!![BRK]

All of the carnival members
have returned safely.[BRK]

And the best part is that
the thicket disappeared!
The exit is now clear![BRK]

[POR10]
That is good news, indeed![BRK]

We were successful in part
because I was able to modify
my dance steps for combat...[BRK]

...But...Giban, the time
has come for me to...[BRK]

[POR00]
...!? Jean, what's the
matter?[BRK]

You seem troubled, dear...[BRK]

[POR10]
I've decided that I'm going
to leave the carnival for
a while.[BRK]

I've got to face some
problems I've been running
away from...[BRK]

I wish I could tell you 
more...Just know that it's
something I must do.[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, I know your demons
haunt you.[BRK]

If the time to face them

Perhaps Karate Master Lunn

You've been given a chance
at redemption. I pray that
you do not waste it.[BRK]

[POR10]
I don't know what to say...[BRK]

[POR00]
Just tell me that you'll
return in one piece. [BRK]

Now get out of here...[END]

=== 3d | 1e73c | 46 ===
[POR02]
...Listen, Hiro! It sounds
like music.[BRK]

What's going on over
there?[END]

=== 3e | 1e78c | 79 ===
[POR10]
Say, how did you find us?
We don't like to be
followed...[BRK]

[POR02]
Relax, we're just passing
through. Let's get going,
Hiro.[END]

=== 3f | 1e81c | 206 ===
[POR10]
Hiro...Hmm, that's the
strangest name I've ever
heard...[BRK]

And this is the most rag-
tag party I've ever seen...[BRK]

A weird flying creature,
a lady in a strange red
dress, and a card shark.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm not strange! Why don't
you take a look at yourself?[BRK]

[POR05]
I'll show you what I really
want to be remembered for.[BRK]

It'll just take five 
minutes...[BRK]

[POR08]
...What's wrong with my
.......dress!?[BRK]

[POR10]
Hey, relax! I wasn't making
fun of you![BRK]

I was just making an

Anyway, you're free to 
stay with us as long as
you like.[END]

We were passing through this

the thicket over there.[BRK]

I don't think there's a way
around it.[BRK]

To make matters worse, we
have heard a terrible noise
coming from the woods.[BRK]

It sounds like a terrible
monster...perhaps the one
that made the thicket.[BRK]

Some of the performers are
getting really scared...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, great! This is the part
where she asks us to help
her...[BRK]

Just watch...I know it's
coming...[END]

=== 43 | 1edd0 | 29f ===
[POR10]
If only I knew exactly where
the sounds were coming from![BRK]

Maybe then I could find the
monster and get back the
kidnapped...[BRK]

[POR02]
What did I say!? Looks like
they need our help.[BRK]

Say Jean, the voices are
coming from the hole in the
eastern tree over there...[BRK]

[POR10]
...What hole!? I...I don't
see any hole in the tree

That's because it has a

We were on our way to the

Plains area.[BRK]

But we seem to be unable
to exit from this part
of the forest.[BRK]

We've just been stuck here
practicing for a carnival
we may never reach...[BRK]

[POR02]
Is that what Jean was doing?
Practicing? It was awfully
good...[BRK]

[POR00]
Oh, you saw Jean dancing?
She's the best dancer we
have.[BRK]

Whenever she creates a new
dance step, she puts on a
show for us.[BRK]

That's what she was doing
earlier...[END]

=== 46 | 1f316 | 108 ===
[POR00]
I met Jean when she was a
scared and lonely young
lady.[BRK]

I've raised her as my own
daughter since she was
found.[BRK]

I think dancing is the only
thing that keeps her from
her dark secrets.[BRK]

I've grown quite attached
to the girl...Don't know
what I'd do without her...[END]

=== 47 | 1f432 | 74 ===
[POR00]
You mark my words, Jean is
going to be the best dancer
in the whole world...[BRK]

...If we all live to see
that day...[END]

=== 48 | 1f4ba | d5 ===
[POR00]
You're going after the
monster that did this, hm?[BRK]

Jean, are you sure you're
making the right decision?[BRK]

I'd die if I lost you...[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, Giban. I have to go.
If I don't, soon we'll all
be captives of this thing.[END]

=== 49 | 1f59e | d3 ===
[POR00]
Well, it looks like we're
ready to get out of this
forest.[BRK]

...Jean, you know that you
can always come with us...[BRK]

I know, you have to take 
care of your past. Just
hurry back...[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[BRK]

Thank you, Giban.[END]

=== 4a | 1f680 | 76 ===
Hey?! How did you get here?[BRK]

If I was you, I would go
back the way you came.[BRK]

I've got a bad feeling about
this place...[END]

=== 4b | 1f70a | eb ===
You'd better hurry and get
out of here before the noise
starts again.[BRK]

I just know it's some sort
of terrible monster...[BRK]

[POR02]
I heard those voices, too.
Come on, Hiro! Let's find
a way outta this place![BRK]

[POR00]
Hopefully...it's not too
late...[END]

=== 4c | 1f7fe | 133 ===
Ohhh nooo! There it is
again! I've gotta get
outta here![BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, the sound seemed to
be coming from the enchanted
path in this tree![BRK]

But these people can't see
it because they don't have
the woodsman's spell...[BRK]

[POR05]
If that creepy sound was
coming from there,[BRK]

that monster has got to
be somewhere nearby...[END]

=== 4d | 1f934 | 39 ===
[POR02]
Oh no, Hiro! Did you see
that? What're we gonna
do???![END]

=== 4e | 1f980 | 91 ===
Jean, thank you for saving
my life. I'm forever in your
debt.[BRK]

[POR10]
No, you're not. You should
be thanking Hiro and the
others for saving your life.[END]

=== 4f | 1fa20 | d0 ===
Don't you just love our
carefree way of life?[BRK]

We have no worries. We take
life one day at a time.[BRK]

This path blockage is our
only problem.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Okay! So it's a big problem!
As if you don't have
problems![END]

=== 50 | 1fb04 | 91 ===
Did...Did you see what just
happened? Oh my god![BRK]

The ground...It just opened
up and swallowed half the
troupe![BRK]

We'll never get out of here
alive![END]

=== 51 | 1fba4 | ad ===
Yes!!! I don't know how to
thank you.[BRK]

If we hurry, we'll be able
to get to the carnival
before it's over, Jean.[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sorry, but I've got
to take care of something
first...[END]

=== 52 | 1fc68 | 94 ===
'Join the carnival! Go see
the world! You'll have an
adventure!' they all said.[BRK]

Now I'm probably stuck in
these creepy woods forever![BRK]

Some life...[END]

=== 53 | 1fd18 | 96 ===
I hate it here. This
carnival is no fun at
all.[BRK]

I knew I should've been an
undertaker...but nooooooo,[BRK]

'Try the carnival,' they all
said. Ha! Some fun![END]

=== 54 | 1fdca | 7e ===
I tell ya, if Althena cared
at all about us, we wouldn't
be stuck here.[BRK]

[POR08]
Why do people blame Althena
for all their problems?[END]

=== 55 | 1fe58 | 99 ===
Geez, it took you forever to
come and find me![BRK]

What were you waiting for?
The monster to eat me?[BRK]

[POR10]
You seem a bit ungrateful
for what we did, don't you?[END]

=== 56 | 1ff00 | d0 ===
Are you tired of those 
phony fortune-tellers?[BRK]

Then step right up! I've got
the best set of cards in the
business.[BRK]

You'll love my friendly, 
quality service.[BRK]

I'm even endorsed by a 
former star of Miami Vice.[END]

=== 57 | 1ffe4 | f0 ===
I knew that you were going
to come and save me, Jean.
I read it in the cards...[BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah, just like you foretold
that the end of the world
was coming five years ago.[BRK]

And the time when you said
that I was going to meet
a handsome stranger...[END]

=== 58 | 200ec | 77 ===
I've just read in the cards
that Jean will be leaving
the carnival...[BRK]

And I also predict that
you will return to us...[END]

=== 59 | 20176 | 60 ===
Ahhh....What a beautiful
day to be alive...[BRK]

The clean, fresh air...
I think I've found paradise![END]

=== 5a | 201ee | 53 ===
I think I'm going to skip
practice today and just take
in the beauty of this place.[END]

=== 5b | 20250 | 92 ===
I'm kinda depressed that you
rescued me.[BRK]

I just love the whole under-
ground cave thing. I wish I
was still there.[BRK]

[POR10]
Uh...I'm sorry...I think...?[END]

=== 5c | 202f2 | 86 ===
Of all the people I have 
taught how to dance, only 
Jean has mastered the art.[BRK]

She is, without a doubt, the
best dancer in the world.[END]

=== 5d | 2038c | 6e ===
Please! You have to find
a way to stop the terrible
monster![BRK]

Our friends...all of our
friends are just...gone![END]

=== 5e | 20408 | 39 ===
[POR10]
Don't worry, we'll find some
way to get them all back![END]

=== 5f | 20454 | 109 ===
Jean! You're still alive!![BRK]

This is great! Now everyone
will know that I'm the best
teacher in the world.[BRK]

There is nobody that can
dance, sing, and fight as
well as you.[BRK]

And I taught you![BRK]

[POR10]
I'm grateful for all that
you have shown me. You
are an excellent teacher.[END]

=== 60 | 20574 | d9 ===
I'm going to make sure that
everyone knows that I 
trained you, Jean...[BRK]

They must know that I 
trained the best fighter 
and dancer in the world.[BRK]

[POR10]
I want to be known for my
dance, not my fighting.
Please honor that.[END]

=== 61 | 2065c | fb ===
Just look at my totally buff
body. It drives the women
mad.[BRK]

They all want to come and 
weave their names in my 
chest hair.[BRK]

[POR05]
Pshaw! That's nothing,
sonny boy.[BRK]

I've had women tattoo my 
name all over their butts![BRK]

[POR02]
I'd tattoo Hiro's name on
my butt![END]

=== 62 | 2076a | ec ===
You can't stay away from my
beauty, can you?[BRK]

Even as darkness falls
around us and our mortal
souls are in danger...[BRK]

...still you appreciate my
smashing good looks.[BRK]

I'm glad that I could bring
some joy to your life in
this dark moment...[END]

=== 63 | 20864 | 11 ===
[POR10]
Oh, please...[END]

=== 64 | 20884 | ea ===
Jean, thank you for saving
me.[BRK]

It would have been a
travesty if a body like this
were destroyed...[BRK]

Now all womankind will once
again be able to shudder at
the sight of perfection...[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm thinking I should've let
the monster eat you.[END]

=== 65 | 20982 | 198 ===
I saw you guys talking with
Jean. Please don't drag her
into any trouble![BRK]

I don't think I could live 
with myself if anything 
ever happened to her...[BRK]

I remember the first day I
saw Jean...[BRK]

She looked as if she was 
dead. Her clothes were torn
and bloody...[BRK]

It was several days before
she even had the strength
to open her eyes.[BRK]

Jean has never told me what
she ran away from, but I 
know it still haunts her.[END]

=== 66 | 20b32 | 6f ===
It was rumored that Jean
used to be a trained 
assassin...[BRK]

But I just can't imagine
dear Jean hurting a fly...[END]

=== 67 | 20bb4 | 48 ===
Now that the monster has
taken all our friends, what
are we going to do?[END]

=== 68 | 20c10 | 78 ===
What's happened to everyone?
Jean, you aren't going to go
fight, are you?[BRK]

[POR10]
...I'll be back. I have to
save my friends![END]

=== 69 | 20c98 | 95 ===
Jean, I've prayed for your
safe return...[BRK]

...and now you're thinking
about leaving again, I hear.[BRK]

[POR10]
I must. I can't run away
from my past forever...[END]

=== 6a | 20d40 | 64 ===
Jean and I are going to 
dance together soon at the
world finals.[BRK]

I know we'll win. Jean's
the best![END]

=== 6b | 20dbc | b1 ===
I will admit that some-
times, I get a bit jealous
of Jean's talent.[BRK]

Usually it's when people are
gaga over her and ignoring
me.[BRK]

I hate myself for it, but
hey! I'm only human...[END]

=== 6c | 20e84 | 5d ===
Oh no, what's happening to
us?[BRK]

Goddess Althena! Please save
us from the evil that is
upon us![END]

=== 6d | 20ef4 | 8a ===
Jean, is it true that you're
going to join forces with
these outsiders?[BRK]

Does Giban know about this?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, so don't worry about
it, okay?[END]

=== 6e | 20f96 | 9a ===
Hey, Jean, if you're leaving,
that means I'm the new head
dancer![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't get too comfortable in
your new position. I'll be 
back before you know it![END]

=== 6f | 21044 | 111 ===
Welcome to our little 
traveling carnival![BRK]

I hope that you'll be able
to stay a while and enjoy 
these pleasant surroundings.[BRK]

We're trying to find a way 
to get past that giant 
thicket up ahead.[BRK]

I hope they find a way
around this thing.[BRK]

Otherwise, I think we're
all stuck.[END]

=== 70 | 2116c | 6a ===
I'm responsible for training
all the wild animals in this
carnival.[BRK]

Wanna see where the lion 
bit me last?[END]

=== 71 | 211ea | 8a ===
Say, we're looking for some
new blood to join us here
in the carnival.[BRK]

[POR02]
Now that half your troupe
got sucked away, I bet you
are...[END]

=== 72 | 21284 | 108 ===
Thank you for saving my 
life! I thought I was going
to die down there.[BRK]

Jean, I didn't know you
could fight like that.[BRK]

Say, I'm going to work out a
new act with you and some of
the wild animals, okay?[BRK]

[POR10]
I don't think so. I won't
fight for the amusement of
others![END]

=== 73 | 213a0 | ba ===
Ke...ke...eeee
Ku ke...ku...ke
Ka ka...ka...ka![BRK]

[POR08]
I don't think I've ever
seen anything like this
before. What is it?[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, hello, Lucia? It's a
bird. Just a dumb old bird.[BRK]

Sheesh....[END]

=== 74 | 21472 | b8 ===
What the hell is going on
here?![BRK]

Wiiillllbbuuurrr![BRK]

[POR08]
Ruby, it can talk! It seems
like it's frightened of
something...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh man! It looks like it's
going to freak out any 
minute now![END]

=== 75 | 2153e | bc ===
Don't just look at me like
that! Unhook me from these
damn wagons!![BRK]

Didn't you see what the
monster just did? We gotta
get outta here![BRK]

[POR02]
I think I liked you better
when you didn't talk...[END]

=== 76 | 2160e | 112 ===
Whew! That was close! At
least you pulled it off at
the last minute![BRK]

I thought we were all
dead meat back there,
Wiiilllburrr![BRK]

[POR02]
Why do you keep calling me
that??!!![BRK]

[POR05]
I think it thinks it's a
horse, of course.[BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, that's ridiculous!
Where'd you ever get that
idea?[END]

=== 77 | 21726 | 12 ===
Ill Woods Clearing[END]

=== 78 | 233f8 | 44a ===
[POR00]
Ah! You've returned! I...I
don't know how to thank
you!![BRK]

All of the carnival members
have returned safely.[BRK]

And the best part is that
the thicket disappeared!
The exit is now clear![BRK]

[POR10]
That is good news, indeed![BRK]

We were successful in part
because I was able to modify
my dance steps for combat...[BRK]

...But...Giban, the time
has come for me to...[BRK]

[POR00]
...!? Jean, what's the
matter?[BRK]

You seem troubled, dear...[BRK]

[POR10]
I've decided that I'm going
to leave the carnival for
a while.[BRK]

I've got to face some
problems I've been running
away from...[BRK]

I wish I could tell you 
more...just know that it's
something I must do.[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, I know your demons
haunt you.[BRK]

If the time to face them
has come, so be it![BRK]

You'll never be at peace 
until you put an end to 
what's troubling you.[BRK]

Perhaps Karate Master Lunn
in Meribia will help you
through this.[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, we've all done things
in the past that we wish we
could change.[BRK]

You've been given a chance
at redemption. I pray that
you do not waste it.[BRK]

[POR10]
I don't know what to say...[BRK]

[POR00]
Just tell me that you'll
return in one piece. [BRK]

Now get out of here...[END]

=== 79 | 2385a | 46 ===
[POR02]
...Listen, Hiro! It sounds
like music.[BRK]

What's going on over
there?[END]

=== 7a | 238aa | 79 ===
[POR10]
Say, how did you find us?
We don't like to be
followed...[BRK]

[POR02]
Relax, we're just passing
through. Let's get going,
Hiro.[END]

=== 7b | 2393a | 206 ===
[POR10]
Hiro...Hmm, that's the
strangest name I've ever
heard...[BRK]

And this is the most rag-
tag party I've ever seen...[BRK]

A weird flying creature,
a lady in a strange red
dress, and a card shark.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm not strange! Why don't
you take a look at yourself?[BRK]

[POR05]
I'll show you what I really
want to be remembered for.[BRK]

It'll just take five 
minutes...[BRK]

[POR08]
...What's wrong with my
.......dress!?[BRK]

[POR10]
Hey, relax! I wasn't making
fun of you![BRK]

I was just making an
observation....[BRK]

Anyway, you're free to 
stay with us as long as
you like.[END]

=== 7c | 23b58 | 121 ===
[POR10]
Hiro, where are you and
your companions headed?[BRK]

What?...The holy city of
Pentagulia! Are you going
to go see the Goddess?[BRK]

I thought that the Goddess
was just a legend...[BRK]

I wonder if she really does
exist?[BRK]

[POR08]
Why do so many people doubt
the existence of Althena?[BRK]

It is so very strange...[END]

=== 7d | 23c94 | 82 ===
[POR10]
Don't be shy. You are free
to go anywhere in our little
caravan.[BRK]

We have no secrets from the
outside world. See for
yourself...[END]

=== 7e | 23d32 | 1a9 ===
[POR10]
We were passing through this
forest, but were stopped by
the thicket over there.[BRK]

I don't think there's a way
around it.[BRK]

To make matters worse, we
have heard a terrible noise
coming from the woods.[BRK]

It sounds like a terrible
monster...perhaps the one
that made the thicket.[BRK]

Some of the performers are
getting really scared...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, great! This is the part
where she asks us to help
her...[BRK]

Just watch...I know it's
coming...[END]

=== 7f | 23eee | 29f ===
[POR10]
If only I knew exactly where
the sounds were coming from![BRK]

Maybe then, I could find the
monster and get back the
kidnapped...[BRK]

[POR02]
What did I say!? Looks like
they need our help.[BRK]

Say, Jean, the voices are
coming from the hole in the
eastern tree over there...[BRK]

[POR10]
...What hole!? I...I don't
see any hole in the tree
over there...???[BRK]

[POR02]
That's because it has a
magic spell on it. Only
we can see it.[BRK]

[POR10]
Hmmm...The magic must've
been cast to keep outsiders
from finding it.[BRK]

Show me this hole...Perhaps
with your help, we can
defeat this, this...beast![BRK]

[POR02]
Of course! We should be able
to make short work of this
thing![BRK]

[POR10]
Let's go![BRK]

I will find a way to get
my friends back...[END]

=== 80 | 24196 | 74 ===
[POR10]
Okay, Ruby, show me the
way.[BRK]

[POR02]
Come on, Hiro, we'd better
hurry and get that monster
before it gets anyone else![END]

=== 81 | 24222 | 1fb ===
[POR00]
Howdy, strangers! My name is
Giban. I'm in charge of this
little caravan.[BRK]

We were on our way to the
carnival in the Madoria
Plains area.[BRK]

But we seem to be unable
to exit from this part
of the forest.[BRK]

We've just been stuck here
practicing for a carnival
we may never reach...[BRK]

[POR02]
Is that what Jean was doing?
Practicing? It was awfully
good...[BRK]

[POR00]
Oh, you saw Jean dancing?
She's the best dancer we
have.[BRK]

Whenever she creates a new
dance step, she puts on a
show for us.[BRK]

That's what she was doing
earlier...[END]

[POR00]
I met Jean when she was a
scared and lonely young

I think dancing is the only

her dark secrets.[BRK]

I've grown quite attached

what I'd do without her...[END]

You mark my words, Jean is

in the whole world...[BRK]

...If we all live to see
that day...[END]

[POR00]
You're going after the
monster that did this, hm?[BRK]

Jean, are you sure you're
making the right decision?[BRK]

I'd die if I lost you...[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, Giban. I have to go.
If I don't, soon we'll all
be captives of this thing.[END]

=== 85 | 246bc | d3 ===
[POR00]
Well, it looks like we're
ready to get out of this
forest.[BRK]

...Jean, you know that you
can always come with us...[BRK]

I know, you have to take 
care of your past. Just
hurry back...[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[BRK]

Thank you, Giban.[END]

Hey?! How did you get here?[BRK]

If I was you, I would go
back the way you came.[BRK]

I've got a bad feeling about
this place...[END]

You'd better hurry and get
out of here before the noise
starts again.[BRK]

I just know it's some sort

Come on Hiro! Let's find
a way outta this place![BRK]

Yes!!! I don't know how to

If we hurry, we'll be able

I'm sorry, but I've got
to take care of something
first...[END]

'Join the carnival! Go see

former star of Miami Vice.[END]

=== 93 | 25102 | f0 ===
I knew that you were going
to come and save me, Jean.
I read it in the cards...[BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah, just like you foretold
that the end of the world
was coming five years ago.[BRK]

And the time when you said
that I was going to meet
a handsome stranger...[END]

=== 94 | 2520a | 77 ===
I've just read in the cards
that Jean will be leaving
the carnival...[BRK]

And I also predict that
you will return to us...[END]

=== 95 | 25294 | 60 ===
Ahhh...What a beautiful
day to be alive...[BRK]

The clean, fresh air...
I think I've found paradise![END]

=== 96 | 2530c | 53 ===
I think I'm going to skip
practice today and just take
in the beauty of this place.[END]

=== 97 | 2536e | 92 ===
I'm kinda depressed that you
rescued me.[BRK]

I just love the whole under-
ground cave thing. I wish I
was still there.[BRK]

[POR10]
Uh...I'm sorry...I think...?[END]

=== 98 | 25410 | 86 ===
Of all the people I have 
taught how to dance, only 
Jean has mastered the art.[BRK]

She is, without a doubt, the
best dancer in the world.[END]

=== 99 | 254aa | 6e ===
Please! You have to find
a way to stop the terrible
monster![BRK]

Our friends...All of our
friends are just...gone![END]

=== 9a | 25526 | 39 ===
[POR10]
Don't worry, we'll find some
way to get them all back![END]

=== 9b | 25572 | 109 ===
Jean! You're still alive!![BRK]

This is great! Now everyone
will know that I'm the best
teacher in the world.[BRK]

There is nobody that can
dance, sing, and fight as
well as you.[BRK]

And I taught you![BRK]

[POR10]
I'm grateful for all that
you have shown me. You
are an excellent teacher.[END]

=== 9c | 25692 | d9 ===
I'm going to make sure that
everyone knows that I 
trained you, Jean...[BRK]

They must know that I 
trained the best fighter 
and dancer in the world.[BRK]

[POR10]
I want to be known for my
dance, not my fighting.
Please honor that.[END]

=== 9d | 2577a | fb ===
Just look at my totally buff
body. It drives the women
mad.[BRK]

They all want to come and 
weave their names in my 
chest hair.[BRK]

[POR05]
Pshaw! That's nothing,
sonny boy.[BRK]

I've had women tattoo my 
name all over their butts![BRK]

[POR02]
I'd tattoo Hiro's name on
my butt![END]

=== 9e | 25888 | ec ===
You can't stay away from my
beauty, can you?[BRK]

Even as darkness falls
around us and our mortal
souls are in danger...[BRK]

...still you appreciate my
smashing good looks.[BRK]

I'm glad that I could bring
some joy to your life in
this dark moment...[END]

=== 9f | 25982 | 11 ===
[POR10]
Oh, please...[END]

=== a0 | 259a2 | ea ===
Jean, thank you for saving
me.[BRK]

It would have been a
travesty if a body like this
were destroyed...[BRK]

Now all womankind will once
again be able to shudder at
the sight of perfection...[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm thinking I should've let
the monster eat you.[END]

=== a1 | 25aa0 | 198 ===
I saw you guys talking with
Jean. Please don't drag her
into any trouble![BRK]

I don't think I could live 
with myself if anything 
ever happened to her...[BRK]

I remember the first day I
saw Jean...[BRK]

She looked as if she was 
dead. Her clothes were torn
and bloody...[BRK]

It was several days before
she even had the strength
to open her eyes.[BRK]

Jean has never told me what
she ran away from, but I 
know it still haunts her.[END]

=== a2 | 25c50 | 6f ===
It was rumored that Jean
used to be a trained 
assassin...[BRK]

But I just can't imagine
dear Jean hurting a fly...[END]

=== a3 | 25cd2 | 48 ===
Now that the monster has
taken all our friends, what
are we going to do?[END]

=== a4 | 25d2e | 78 ===
What's happened to everyone?
Jean, you aren't going to go
fight, are you?[BRK]

[POR10]
...I'll be back. I have to
save my friends![END]

=== a5 | 25db6 | 95 ===
Jean, I've prayed for your
safe return...[BRK]

...and now you're thinking
about leaving again, I hear.[BRK]

[POR10]
I must. I can't run away
from my past forever...[END]

=== a6 | 25e5e | 64 ===
Jean and I are going to 
dance together soon at the
world finals.[BRK]

I know we'll win. Jean's
the best![END]

=== a7 | 25eda | b1 ===
I will admit that some-
times, I get a bit jealous
of Jean's talent.[BRK]

Usually it's when people are
gaga over her and ignoring
me.[BRK]

I hate myself for it, but
hey! I'm only human...[END]

=== a8 | 25fa2 | 5d ===
Oh no, what's happening to
us?[BRK]

Goddess Althena! Please save
us from the evil that is
upon us![END]

=== a9 | 26012 | 8a ===
Jean, is it true that you're
going to join forces with
these outsiders?[BRK]

Does Giban know about this?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, so don't worry about
it, okay?[END]

=== aa | 260b4 | 9a ===
Hey, Jean, if you're leaving,
that means I'm the new head
dancer![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't get too comfortable in
your new position. I'll be 
back before you know it![END]

=== ab | 26162 | 111 ===
Welcome to our little 
traveling carnival![BRK]

I hope that you'll be able
to stay a while and enjoy 
these pleasant surroundings.[BRK]

We're trying to find a way 
to get past that giant 
thicket up ahead.[BRK]

I hope they find a way
around this thing.[BRK]

Otherwise, I think we're
all stuck.[END]

I'm responsible for training
all the wild animals in this
carnival.[BRK]

Wanna see where the lion 
bit me last?[END]

=== ad | 26308 | 8a ===
Say, we're looking for some
new blood to join us here
in the carnival.[BRK]

[POR02]
Now that half your troupe
got sucked away, I bet you
are...[END]

=== ae | 263a2 | 108 ===
Thank you for saving my 
life! I thought I was going
to die down there.[BRK]

Jean, I didn't know you
could fight like that.[BRK]

Say, I'm going to work out a
new act with you and some of
the wild animals, okay?[BRK]

[POR10]
I don't think so. I won't
fight for the amusement of
others![END]

=== af | 264be | ba ===
Ke...ke...eeee
Ku ke...ku...ke
Ka ka...ka...ka![BRK]

[POR08]
I don't think I've ever
seen anything like this
before. What is it?[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, hello, Lucia? It's a
bird. Just a dumb old bird.[BRK]

Sheesh...[END]

What the hell is going on
here?![BRK]

Wiiillllbbuuurrr![BRK]

Ruby, it can talk! It seems
like it's frightened of
something...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh man! It looks like it's
going to freak out any 
minute now![END]

=== b1 | 2665c | bc ===
Don't just look at me like
that! Unhook me from these
damn wagons!![BRK]

Didn't you see what the
monster just did? We gotta
get outta here![BRK]

[POR02]
I think I liked you better
when you didn't talk...[END]

=== b2 | 2672c | 112 ===
Whew! That was close! At
least you pulled it off at
the last minute![BRK]

I thought we were all
dead meat back there,
Wiiilllburrr![BRK]

[POR02]
Why do you keep calling me
that??!!![BRK]

[POR05]
I think it thinks it's a
horse, of course.[BRK]

idea?[END]

My big sister Jean is a fan
dancer now, but I heard she
used to be a karate master![BRK]

Okay, so she's not my real
sister, but we were raised
together.[BRK]

One day, I want to grow up
to be a strong karate
fighter![BRK]

I've asked Jean to teach me
karate, but she always gets
sad when I mention it.[BRK]

I wish I knew why she did
that...[END]

=== b5 | 2853e | 75 ===
I want to learn to be a
karate master, but my sister
won't teach me.[BRK]

I love making the noise...[BRK]

Hiiiiiiii---yaaaaaaa![END]

=== b6 | 285c6 | 4a ===
I'm scared! Please defeat
the bad monster before it
takes any more people![END]

=== b7 | 2861e | 4e ===
[POR10]
I'll do what I can, little
brother. But I don't think
I need to use karate.[END]

=== b8 | 2867c | 15d ===
Jean...You're going to leave
us, aren't you? Please don't
go![BRK]

I-I need you to stay so you
can teach me karate![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't worry, little brother.
I'll be back soon to teach
you what you need to know.[BRK]

But I won't teach you the
aggressive karate of death,
only the defensive moves.[BRK]

That's all you need to know
to become a strong defender
of our troupe.[END]

=== b9 | 287e8 | 11e ===
That Jean! Always pretending
no one notices her![BRK]

Before she came, I was the
best dancer in our caravan![BRK]

Then, we had to go and
rescue that stupid girl![BRK]

When we found her she was
just a poor urchin in torn
karate rags![BRK]

Hah! I wish she had never
joined us. Then I would
still be the best![END]

=== ba | 2891a | 43 ===
Ah...ahhh...ahhhh! That...
that thing! It's going to
kill us all![END]

=== bb | 28970 | 75 ===
Jean...This is really
tough for me to admit,[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

But you saved our caravan,
and I owe you my deepest
thanks.[END]

=== bc | 289fc | ff ===
I've been jealous of your
talent. I want that to
change.[BRK]

Jean, I know we haven't been
the best of friends, but I'd
like to try.[BRK]

[POR10]
Oh! That's so good to hear
from you! I never wanted to
be rivals anyway.[BRK]

From now on, we're nothing
but the best of friends![END]

=== bd | 28b0e | 1f8 ===
...Oh Jean! Do you know the
affection I feel for you?[BRK]

Ever since I first saw your
flowing skirt rise in tempo
to the music...I knew.[BRK]

I don't care that your past
is shrouded in secrecy. I
can live with your sins.[BRK]

I want to be with you, to
hold you...to, to...rub warm
goat's milk on your...[BRK]

[POR02]
Whew! Is it getting hot in
here? I think it's getting
hotter in here...[BRK]

You know, I think this Jean
gal needs to be warned about
this guy.[BRK]

[POR00]
Warned? Why? Why would you
have to warn Jean of the
depth of my love?[END]

=== be | 28d1e | 8c ===
Jean, Jean, jelly bean. Let
me wrap my tongue around
your gourmet sweets...[BRK]

[POR02]
Have you said this stuff to
Jean's face?[BRK]

I bet she'd slap it![END]

=== bf | 28dbe | 15f ===
What? A monster is attacking
our caravan?! Oh, why'd it
have to be today!!??[BRK]

If I didn't have diarrhea, 
I'd be able to show Jean
my brave skill![BRK]

[POR02]
Um, yeah...right. Diarrhea.
You should try anyway.[BRK]

Maybe you could immobilize
the monster like one of
those sticky-foam guns.[BRK]

It could be your secret
weapon.[BRK]

Hehe...or better yet...your
stinky weapon...[END]

=== c0 | 28f30 | bd ===
Oh Jean! I knew you would
be able to defeat that
terrible, terrible monster.[BRK]

Jean...sweetheart, come to
me so I can hold you close.[BRK]

[POR10]
Excuse me? Do I know you?[BRK]

There must be some mistake.[END]

=== c1 | 29004 | a1 ===
I've heard you're leaving
the caravan, Jean.[BRK]

Just know that anytime you
need a shoulder to cry on,
I'll be here waiting.[BRK]

Excuse me? Where is this
coming from?[END]

La la la la la la la

I just love to sing. It does
something to my spirit, my
soul...[BRK]

But the head of the Althena
Cult doesn't allow any song
in his shrine![BRK]

I thought that was strange,
since the Althena of legend
was known for her singing...[BRK]

[POR08]
But what is the purpose of
song? I don't understand...[END]

O goddess of light, sing
for me a song tonight.[BRK]

Man! This guy must really
like singing! He never
stops![END]

=== c6 | 2990a | 169 ===
In return for you helping
our little caravan, I'll
make a song for you.[BRK]

It starts out like this...[BRK]

'Welcome to the jungle, we
got weeds to tame...[BRK]

If they stoke your allergies
well, it's the price you
pay.'[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

What do you think? I just
made that part up! I'll work
on the rest...[BRK]

[POR02]
I can't put my finger right
on it, but that sounds
awfully familiar...[END]

I'm afraid I'm not a very
good dancer. Especially
compared to Jean.[BRK]

But I keep trying. Someday
I hope to dance in one of
the festivals to Althena.[BRK]

[POR08]
Why do they dance at these
festivals to Althena?[BRK]

Did Althena tell them to?
I don't understand any of
this...[END]

Ohhhh! This is terrible!
Just terrible...The monster
will get us all, eventually![END]

It's called a Magic Arrow.
It'll be one of our most
popular attractions.[BRK]

Attractions? Looks more like
an accident waiting to
happen to me![BRK]

[POR00]
Oh, no! It's quite safe, I'm
certain.[BRK]

I've got it all worked out
on paper, and we've already
sent monkeys up in it![BRK]

Aside from a little brain
swelling, they're fine.[BRK]

Besides, I think I've fixed
the thing that caused that
anyway...[END]

If only this Magic Arrow

Oh dear...oh dear...[END]
