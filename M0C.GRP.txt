I sincerely hope you enjoyed
my little 'detour.'[BRK]

Face it! You simpletons are
no match for my superior
intellect.[BRK]

You can't escape the power
of the dragonship destiny![BRK]

Surrender now![BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro, he's right! We have
no chance of surviving a
blast from his ship![BRK]

What are we going to do?[BRK]

[POR08]
I cannot surrender. I must
accomplish my mission, so I
must fight.[BRK]

[POR05]
If luck goes our way, we
just might stand a chance.
I'm willing to try![BRK]

[POR10]
I knew that following you
guys was a mistake.[BRK]

But not fighting now would
be a bigger one.[BRK]

I'm in.[BRK]

[POR07]
This situation looks bad all
around, and i don't see how
i'll profit from fighting.[BRK]

Why don't we just surrender?[BRK]

[POR09]
Stop your little secret 
conference and surrender to
me immediately![BRK]

My given task is to execute
lucia before she destroys
us all.[BRK]

Know that i have the will
and the resources to carry
out that task...

Ahhhh! The evil lucia
is raining fire down
upon us! Help![BRK]

[POR09]
You morons! There is no
danger! Althena will
protect us![BRK]

You can't be hurt![END]

This doesn't make any sense.
Why would he go out of his
way to help us???[END]

=== 7 | 148ac | 53 ===
Lord leo has been badly
injured! Quick, we must
get him to safety![BRK]

Retreat at once![END]

This whole trip just keeps
getting weirder and 
weirder...[BRK]

[POR05]
Agreed! I don't know what
the heck's goin' on anymore![BRK]

Anyway, it's bought us some
time. Let's take advantage
of it.[END]
