Oh great! The door's
locked![BRK]

Maybe there's another
way in...[END]

I'm sorry, but this room
is off-limits to commoners.[BRK]

You cannot enter this room
without Lord Leo's direct
order.[END]

=== 2 | 1707a | 5b ===
Leo demands perfect service
from his loyal servants.[BRK]

And I, for one, will not
let him down.[END]

=== 3 | 170e4 | f2 ===
Lord Leo is relentless when
he has been given an
assignment.[BRK]

We will not rest until he
has seen it through to
completion.[BRK]

And heaven help the poor
soul that gets in his way![BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, we sorta had a first-
hand demonstration of that
already...

[END]

=== 4 | 171ea | 9a ===
I really need a vacation. [BRK]

I've been working day and
night helping Leo for what
seems like forever![BRK]

His passion for his work is
going to be the end of me![END]

=== 5 | 17294 | a9 ===
I really don't have the
mental fortitude to under-
stand what's going on.[BRK]

But I guess that's how
Lord Leo likes it.[BRK]

He only enlisted me because
I'm an awesome swordsman.[END]

=== 6 | 17350 | 9d ===
Since I've been fighting 
alongside Leo, we've never
lost a battle.[BRK]

In fact, I kinda have this
superstition...[BRK]

As long as we're winning,
I don't take a bath.[END]

Man, I guess Ghaleon is more
powerful than we thought![BRK]

I knew that Leo was a no-
good traitor! He's working
for that evil Althena![BRK]

We've got to find a way to
get out of here...[BRK]

...Wherever 'here' is...

...Lucia?[BRK]

I don't know what happened
to Lucia. [BRK]

The last time I saw her, she
was laid out on the floor of
Althena's audience chamber.[BRK]

Hiro...I hope she's all
right![BRK]

If the Goddess really is
a fake like Lucia said,
we're all in big trouble![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR02]
We've got to find a way
out of here and then
find the others![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...Uh...Any ideas?

...You there! Listen up![BRK]

I've come to rescue you.
Do as I say and we'll all
get out of here alive![BRK]

Now then, follow me![BRK]

[POR02]
L-Le...Leo! What are you
doing here?[BRK]

I thought you were the
servant of that no-good
phony Althena!?[BRK]

What are you doing trying
to help us?[BRK]

[POR13]
Uh...er...I am not White
Knight Leo.[BRK]

I...am...I...am...[BRK]

....
.....uh....[BRK]

...I'm Mystere! Protector
of the innocent and...uh...
defender of truth![BRK]

Hurry! You must follow me
or your lives will be lost![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR02]
Come on, Leo! Knock off the
party games and tell us
what's really happening![BRK]

[POR13]
Silence, cat! I am Mystere.
I know not the 'Leo' of
which you speak![BRK]

[POR02]
Okay...right. Mystere. I
get it. Whatever...[BRK]

[POR13]
My true identity shall
remain a secret, but I have
knowledge to impart to you.[BRK]

Listen very carefully...[BRK]

There are four towers in
Pentagulia, each with a
prison on the top floor.[BRK]

They are connected by an
underground network of
passages.[BRK]

You are in the White Tower.
Your friends lie in the
other towers.[BRK]

But I have no information
on the girl you call Lucia.[BRK]

Since she tried to murder
the Goddess, her fate is
probably execution.[BRK]

I will help you release
Ronfar and the two girls
from their cells.[BRK]

What you do after that is
your own business.[BRK]

Come quickly! Time rapidly
escapes us!

If my memory serves me
right...[BRK]

The secret exit from this
room is somewhere along
these walls.[BRK]

We must find it![END]
