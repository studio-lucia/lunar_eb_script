Oh great! The door's
locked![BRK]

Maybe there's another
way in...[END]

I'm sorry, but this room
is off-limits to commoners.[BRK]

You cannot enter this room
without lord leo's direct
order.[END]

=== 2 | 1707a | 5b ===
Leo demands perfect service
from his loyal servants.[BRK]

And i, for one, will not
let him down.[END]

=== 3 | 170e4 | f2 ===
Lord leo is relentless when
he has been given an
assignment.[BRK]

We will not rest until he
has seen it through to
completion.[BRK]

And heaven help the poor
soul that gets in his way![BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, we sorta had a first-
hand demonstration of that
already...

[END]

=== 4 | 171ea | 9a ===
I really need a vacation. [BRK]

I've been working day and
night helping leo for what
seems like forever![BRK]

His passion for his work is
going to be the end of me![END]

=== 5 | 17294 | a9 ===
I really don't have the
mental fortitude to under-
stand what's going on.[BRK]

But i guess that's how
lord leo likes it.[BRK]

He only enlisted me because
i'm an awesome swordsman.[END]

=== 6 | 17350 | 9d ===
Since i've been fighting 
alongside leo, we've never
lost a battle.[BRK]

In fact, i kinda have this
superstition...[BRK]

As long as we're winning,
i don't take a bath.[END]

Man, i guess ghaleon is more
powerful than we thought![BRK]

I knew that leo was a no-
good traitor! He's working
for that evil althena![BRK]

We've got to find a way to
get out of here...[BRK]

...wherever 'here' is...
[END]

...lucia?[BRK]

I don't know what happened
to lucia. [BRK]

The last time i saw her, she
was laid out on the floor of
althena's audience chamber.[BRK]

Hiro...i hope she's all
right![BRK]

If the goddess really is
a fake like lucia said,
we're all in big trouble![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR02]
We've got to find a way
out of here and then
find the others![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...uh...any ideas?

[POR13]
...you there! Listen up![BRK]

I've come to rescue you.
Do as i say and we'll all
get out of here alive![BRK]

Now then, follow me![BRK]

[POR02]
L-le...leo! What are you
doing here?[BRK]

I thought you were the
servant of that no-good
phony althena!?[BRK]

What are you doing trying
to help us?[BRK]

[POR13]
Uh...er...i am not white
knight leo.[BRK]

I...am...i...am...[BRK]

....
.....uh....[BRK]

...i'm mystere! Protector
of the innocent and...uh...
defender of truth![BRK]

Hurry! You must follow me
or your lives will be lost![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR02]
Come on, leo! Knock off the
party games and tell us
what's really happening![BRK]

[POR13]
Silence, cat! I am mystere.
I know not the 'leo' of
which you speak![BRK]

[POR02]
Okay...right. Mystere. I
get it. Whatever...[BRK]

[POR13]
My true identity shall
remain a secret, but i have
knowledge to impart to you.[BRK]

Listen very carefully...[BRK]

There are four towers in
pentagulia, each with a
prison on the top floor.[BRK]

They are connected by an
underground network of
passages.[BRK]

You are in the white tower.
Your friends lie in the
other towers.[BRK]

But i have no information
on the girl you call lucia.[BRK]

Since she tried to murder
the goddess, her fate is
probably execution.[BRK]

I will help you release
ronfar and the two girls
from their cells.[BRK]

What you do after that is
your own business.[BRK]

Come quickly! Time rapidly
escapes us!

The secret exit from this
room is somewhere along
these walls.[BRK]

We must find it![END]
