...hey, hiro!
Look over there!![BRK]

[POR09]
Oh my god...i don't believe
it...it's......it's mauri!![END]

=== 1 | 18884 | 3bc ===
[POR15]
My, my! Ronfar! What an
unexpected surprise![BRK]

[POR05]
Mauri...oh, mauri...why?
Why have you done this?[BRK]

These people were innocent
...and you slaughtered them![BRK]

What's happened to you?[BRK]

[POR15]
Ha ha ha ha ha![BRK]

Mauri giveth and mauri
taketh away....[BRK]

[POR05]
I...i know that the ritual
changed you, but you can't
continue like this![BRK]

Has your heart turned as
black as night?[BRK]

Please! If you have any
love for me left in your
heart...let us pass.[BRK]

[POR15]
Ohhh...ronfar...that's...
that's so...[BRK]

...pathetic![BRK]

Do you think i can forgive
you for leaving me after
the plague?[BRK]

My service is to althena
now. I have no room in my
heart for you.[BRK]

She has ordered lucia's
execution, and i will not
fail her.[BRK]

[POR05]
But mauri...you're simply
being used...[BRK]

[POR15]
Silence! Hand over lucia
or forever regret your
actions![BRK]

[POR05]
...but...ma...mauri!?[BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! Enough of this talk!
Come on, sister! Time to
put up or shut up![BRK]

[POR10]
We will never surrender
lucia to agents of evil![BRK]

She's our only hope![BRK]

[POR08]
But...
[END]

=== 2 | 18c44 | f7 ===
[POR09]
Mauri![BRK]

Enough of this foolishness![BRK]

I have been given the
authority to eradicate the
destroyer, not you![BRK]

Report back to althena at
once and leave this to
me![BRK]

I think i have found a
better way...[BRK]

...and you're only making
things more complicated.[END]

=== 3 | 18d44 | 1b1 ===
[POR09]
Enough, mauri![BRK]

I'll have no more talk of
this sort![BRK]

Leave...now![BRK]

Until althena informs me to
the contrary, i and i alone
shall bring lucia to her.[BRK]

You have no part in this,
mauri. Leave it to me.[BRK]

[POR15]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR15]
As you wish, my brother.[BRK]

But you have already proven
your spine is as jelly.[BRK]

The goddess will judge your
actions once you reach
pentagulia.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Oh...and good-bye, dear
ronfar. You haven't seen
the last of me...[END]

=== 4 | 18ef8 | 12f ===
[POR09]
Hiro, ronfar, i apologize
for mauri's actions.[BRK]

I don't know why she's
become as she has.[BRK]

Somehow, althena has changed
her, and not for the better.[BRK]

But enough of that.[BRK]

We've wasted too much time
here.[BRK]

Lucia, i will take you
to pentagulia on the
destiny.[BRK]

Then we can finally get
to the bottom of this.
[END]

=== 5 | 19044 | 31 ===
Lo...lord leo...
i...c...couldn't
stop...them...
[END]

=== 6 | 1908c | be ===
S..Si...sir...i'm s-sorry!
I...i...could...not...stop
...them...[BRK]

Mauri...she's...she's...
gonna...kill...[BRK]

[POR09]
Shhh! Rest! I will take
care of this.[BRK]

Conserve your strength until
help arrives.
[END]

=== 7 | 19166 | 3f ===
L-lord...l-l-le...[BRK]

[POR09]
Rest quietly. You are
gravely injured...
[END]

=== 8 | 191b8 | 43 ===
I...i've...failed...
you...sir...pleeease...
for...forgive me...

Azado tower path[END]

=== a | 19b3c | 1e5 ===
[POR05]
Ahhh! This is the transport
device that can carry us
to pentagulia.[BRK]

[POR07]
Strange. It looks very 
similar to the transmission
spring in vane.[BRK]

[POR02]
Well, i think that they look
completely different. After
all...[BRK]

[POR05]
It doesn't matter how it
looks! All that matters is
that it will take us there.[BRK]

Let me activate it...[BRK]

Magic pedestal, heed my
command![BRK]

I, ronfar, servant to the
goddess althena, summon
forth your awesome power![BRK]

Release the power of
transport and open the door
of eternity!
[END]

=== b | 19d24 | 197 ===
[POR01]
...![BRK]

[POR02]
Holy cow! What did you do,
ronfar?![BRK]

You summoned some sort of
...of...of...m-monster![BRK]

[POR05]
I don't know what happened!
The gateway should have just
opened...[BRK]

...but instead, we got
this...thing![BRK]

[POR10]
Oh no! What if this is the
magic beast the villagers
were talking about?![BRK]

[POR08]
I sense the vile presence of
zophar's black power...[BRK]

...it's getting stronger![BRK]

[POR07]
Oh no! Look out! It's going
to attack!


[END]

=== c | 19edc | 360 ===
[POR05]
What in the world is going
on here!?[BRK]

I know that this is the
transport device that
leads to pentagulia![BRK]

But instead of transporting
us there, it summoned a
fearsome beast![BRK]

[POR08]
Look! It is surrounded by
a strange inscription.[BRK]

[POR02]
This is really weird! I've
never seen runes like that![BRK]

I think you've just got the
wrong pedestal, ronfar![BRK]

[POR05]
No, this is the right one,
but lucia's on to something![BRK]

Those runes are not supposed
to be here.[BRK]

They're what corrupted my
spell and summoned the
monster![BRK]

[POR07]
I wonder if the priests
of althena's cult were the
ones that changed it![BRK]

If they did, we're all
in big trouble![BRK]

And lucia said she sensed
zophar's power when the
device was activated![BRK]

Ohhh, i knew we should've
bought those beads...[BRK]

[POR10]
But would the beads have
made a difference?[BRK]

[POR05]
...couldn't have hurt![BRK]

I, for one am going back
to find out what's going
on here!


[END]

=== d | 1a240 | 434 ===
[POR09]
Ah! Well, we meet again,
at last![BRK]

[POR05]
Leo...what are you doing
here?[BRK]

[POR09]
Ronfar, i'm surprised at
your lack of planning![BRK]

Didn't you remember that
azado is the home port of
the destiny?[BRK]

You of all people should
know that![BRK]

[POR05]
Okay, ya got me there, but
we had to get to the
transport device.[BRK]

And i guess it just slipped
my mind...[BRK]

Leo, tell me you didn't know 
about this magical beast![BRK]

[POR09]
...beast? I've heard that
there is a magical beast
in this town, but...[BRK]

[POR05]
...i can't believe that you
would be responsible for
something like this...[BRK]

I can't believe that you've
sunk to this level! Leo,
you're fighting for evil![BRK]

[POR09]
What are you talking about
ronfar? You're making no
sense, but...[BRK]

I've had enough of your 
deceit. Soldiers! Take all
of them to the destiny!![BRK]

[POR00]
Yes, sir![BRK]

You there! Come with me![BRK]

[POR10]
Hey! Watch where you're
grabbin', pal![BRK]

[POR07]
...i can't believe that
leo was involved in that
summoning...[BRK]

But what a great scam! 
Selling those stupid beads
was one way to get rich.[BRK]

[POR05]
I thought leo was different.
The leo i knew would never
stoop this low...[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[END]

=== e | 1a678 | 178 ===
[POR09]
...wait! The boy must
stay here with me.[BRK]

Take the others to the 
destiny and wait for us
there.[BRK]

I will question the boy
privately.[BRK]

[POR00]
Lord leo, are you sure you 
don't want one of us to
stay with you?[BRK]

[POR09]
Ha ha ha! Do you believe
that the mighty lord leo
can be overcome by a boy?[BRK]

Your comedic sensibility is
greater than i had imagined.[BRK]

I will be fine. Just leave
us now...[END]

=== f | 1a80c | 118 ===
[POR09]
Hiro, i have a question to
ask, and you must answer it
to the best of your ability.[BRK]

You've spent quite a bit of
time with lucia during your
travels.[BRK]

And i believe that you know
lucia better than anyone
in this world.[BRK]

Tell me, do you think that
lucia is the foretold
destroyer?
[END]

=== 10 | 1a928 | 2b ===
[0x5]Lucia is the destroyer.
Only once a month.[END]

=== 11 | 1a962 | 77 ===
[POR09]
Hiro! I'm not in the mood
for your sarcastic answers.[BRK]

I must have a straight
answer![BRK]

Our world hangs in the
balance![END]

=== 12 | 1a9ee | 1d2 ===
[POR01]
Leo, believe me when i tell
you that there is nothing
evil about lucia.[BRK]

Her intentions are as pure
as the driven snow.[BRK]

[POR09]
Hmmm...that's what i've
begun to suspect.[BRK]

She does not seem to be a
threat to the good in our
world.[BRK]

But why must she meet with
the goddess?[BRK]

It makes no sense to me...[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR09]
Hiro, you must tell me what
lucia will do when she meets
the goddess.[BRK]

You're her friend. She must
have told you...[BRK]

[POR00]
...lord leo, what are you 
doing here?[END]

=== 13 | 1abca | 13a ===
Entry into this tower is
strictly prohibited by
althena's followers![BRK]

By what authority have you
come?[BRK]

[POR09]
I, lord leo, have come by
the authority of althena
herself![BRK]

[POR00]
Lord leo, if althena truly
sent you, you would know
of our plans.[BRK]

Since you do not, i must
silence you once and for
all![BRK]

Magic beast...come forth![END]

=== 14 | 1ad18 | a1 ===
[POR09]
...this...this makes no
sense...[BRK]

The members of althena's
cult seem to have gone wild![BRK]

I cannot believe that
althena is involved, but
maybe ronfar is right...[END]

=== 15 | 1add0 | 68 ===
[POR09]
Listen, hiro, this time you
must give me a straight
answer.[BRK]

Tell me, is lucia the
foretold destroyer?[END]

=== 16 | 1ae54 | 194 ===
[POR09]
What in the name of the
goddess althena is going on
in this place?[BRK]

[POR00]
Ha, ha, ha...you don't need
to trouble yourself with
those details, dear leo.[BRK]

In fact, your time has
run out.[BRK]

Now that you know of our
secret scheme, we cannot
let you live.[BRK]

I have commanded hordes of
monsters into this tower
to eliminate you![BRK]

I'm sure that even with all
your power you will not 
survive![BRK]

Our secret dies with you![END]

=== 17 | 1b004 | c8 ===
Have you come to beg for
your very lives?[BRK]

I have no sympathy for you
now. Go...face the fate
you have earned.[BRK]

[POR09]
Know this, cretin! When I
get out of here, you will
pay dearly for this![BRK]

I promise you![END]

=== 18 | 1b0e4 | 11c ===
[POR09]
...hiro, if we are to
survive, we must put our
differences aside.[BRK]

If we work together, we
may be able to escape this
death trap.[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR09]
Know that it was not my
intention to drag you into
this mess.[BRK]

Pray that the goddess is
with us, hiro.[BRK]

Let's go...[BRK]

[POR02]
Here goes nothing![END]

couldn't stop them from
taking lucia![BRK]
