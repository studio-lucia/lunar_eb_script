...Hey, Hiro!
Look over there!![BRK]

[POR09]
Oh my god...I don't believe
it...It's......It's Mauri!![END]

=== 1 | 18884 | 3bc ===
[POR15]
My, my! Ronfar! What an
unexpected surprise![BRK]

[POR05]
Mauri...Oh, Mauri...Why?
Why have you done this?[BRK]

These people were innocent
...and you slaughtered them![BRK]

What's happened to you?[BRK]

[POR15]
Ha ha ha ha ha![BRK]

Mauri giveth and Mauri
taketh away....[BRK]

[POR05]
I...I know that the ritual
changed you, but you can't
continue like this![BRK]

Has your heart turned as
black as night?[BRK]

Please! If you have any
love for me left in your
heart...let us pass.[BRK]

[POR15]
Ohhh...Ronfar...that's...
that's so...[BRK]

...pathetic![BRK]

Do you think I can forgive
you for leaving me after
the plague?[BRK]

My service is to Althena
now. I have no room in my
heart for you.[BRK]

She has ordered Lucia's
execution, and I will not
fail her.[BRK]

[POR05]
But Mauri...You're simply
being used...[BRK]

[POR15]
Silence! Hand over Lucia
or forever regret your
actions![BRK]

[POR05]
...But...Ma...Mauri!?[BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! Enough of this talk!
Come on, sister! Time to
put up or shut up![BRK]

[POR10]
We will never surrender
Lucia to agents of evil![BRK]

She's our only hope![BRK]

[POR08]
But...[END]

=== 2 | 18c44 | f7 ===
[POR09]
Mauri![BRK]

Enough of this foolishness![BRK]

I have been given the
authority to eradicate the
destroyer, not you![BRK]

Report back to Althena at
once and leave this to
me![BRK]

I think I have found a
better way...[BRK]

...and you're only making
things more complicated.[END]

=== 3 | 18d44 | 1b1 ===
[POR09]
Enough, Mauri![BRK]

I'll have no more talk of
this sort![BRK]

Leave...now![BRK]

Until Althena informs me to
the contrary, I and I alone
shall bring Lucia to her.[BRK]

You have no part in this,
Mauri. Leave it to me.[BRK]

[POR15]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR15]
As you wish, my brother.[BRK]

But you have already proven
your spine is as jelly.[BRK]

The Goddess will judge your
actions once you reach
Pentagulia.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Oh...and good-bye, dear
Ronfar. You haven't seen
the last of me...[END]

=== 4 | 18ef8 | 12f ===
[POR09]
Hiro, Ronfar, I apologize
for Mauri's actions.[BRK]

I don't know why she's
become as she has.[BRK]

Somehow, Althena has changed
her, and not for the better.[BRK]

But enough of that.[BRK]

We've wasted too much time
here.[BRK]

Lucia, I will take you
to Pentagulia on the
Destiny.[BRK]

Then we can finally get
to the bottom of this.[END]

=== 5 | 19044 | 31 ===
Lo...Lord Leo...
I...c...couldn't
stop...them...[END]

=== 6 | 1908c | be ===
S..Si...Sir...I'm s-sorry!
I...I...could...not...stop
...them...[BRK]

Mauri...she's...she's...
gonna...kill...[BRK]

[POR09]
Shhh! Rest! I will take
care of this.[BRK]

Conserve your strength until
help arrives.[END]

=== 7 | 19166 | 3f ===
L-Lord...L-L-Le...[BRK]

[POR09]
Rest quietly. You are
gravely injured...[END]

=== 8 | 191b8 | 43 ===
I...I've...failed...
you...sir...Pleeease...
for...forgive me...[END]

=== 9 | 19200 | 10 ===
Azado Tower Path[END]

=== a | 19b3c | 1e5 ===
[POR05]
Ahhh! This is the transport
device that can carry us
to Pentagulia.[BRK]

[POR07]
Strange. It looks very 
similar to the Transmission
Spring in Vane.[BRK]

[POR02]
Well, I think that they look
completely different. After
all...[BRK]

[POR05]
It doesn't matter how it
looks! All that matters is
that it will take us there.[BRK]

Let me activate it...[BRK]

Magic pedestal, heed my
command![BRK]

I, Ronfar, servant to the
Goddess Althena, summon
forth your awesome power![BRK]

Release the power of
transport and open the door
of eternity![END]

=== b | 19d24 | 197 ===
[POR01]
...![BRK]

[POR02]
Holy cow! What did you do,
Ronfar?![BRK]

You summoned some sort of
...of...of...m-monster![BRK]

[POR05]
I don't know what happened!
The gateway should have just
opened...[BRK]

...But instead, we got
this...thing![BRK]

[POR10]
Oh no! What if this is the
magic beast the villagers
were talking about?![BRK]

[POR08]
I sense the vile presence of
Zophar's black power...[BRK]

...It's getting stronger![BRK]

[POR07]
Oh no! Look out! It's going
to attack![END]

=== c | 19edc | 360 ===
[POR05]
What in the world is going
on here!?[BRK]

I know that this is the
transport device that
leads to Pentagulia![BRK]

But instead of transporting
us there, it summoned a
fearsome beast![BRK]

[POR08]
Look! It is surrounded by
a strange inscription.[BRK]

[POR02]
This is really weird! I've
never seen runes like that![BRK]

I think you've just got the
wrong pedestal, Ronfar![BRK]

[POR05]
No, this is the right one,
but Lucia's on to something![BRK]

Those runes are not supposed
to be here.[BRK]

They're what corrupted my
spell and summoned the
monster![BRK]

[POR07]
I wonder if the priests
of Althena's Cult were the
ones that changed it![BRK]

If they did, we're all
in big trouble![BRK]

And Lucia said she sensed
Zophar's power when the
device was activated![BRK]

Ohhh, I knew we should've
bought those beads...[BRK]

[POR10]
But would the beads have
made a difference?[BRK]

[POR05]
...Couldn't have hurt![BRK]

I, for one am going back
to find out what's going
on here![END]

=== d | 1a240 | 434 ===
[POR09]
Ah! Well, we meet again,
at last![BRK]

[POR05]
Leo...What are you doing
here?[BRK]

[POR09]
Ronfar, I'm surprised at
your lack of planning![BRK]

Didn't you remember that
Azado is the home port of
the Destiny?[BRK]

You of all people should
know that![BRK]

[POR05]
Okay, ya got me there, but
we had to get to the
transport device.[BRK]

And I guess it just slipped
my mind...[BRK]

Leo, tell me you didn't know 
about this magical beast![BRK]

[POR09]
...Beast? I've heard that
there is a magical beast
in this town, but...[BRK]

[POR05]
...I can't believe that you
would be responsible for
something like this...[BRK]

I can't believe that you've
sunk to this level! Leo,
you're fighting for evil![BRK]

[POR09]
What are you talking about
Ronfar? You're making no
sense, but...[BRK]

I've had enough of your 
deceit. Soldiers! Take all
of them to the Destiny!![BRK]

[POR00]
Yes, sir![BRK]

You there! Come with me![BRK]

[POR10]
Hey! Watch where you're
grabbin', pal![BRK]

[POR07]
...I can't believe that
Leo was involved in that
summoning...[BRK]

But what a great scam! 
Selling those stupid beads
was one way to get rich.[BRK]

[POR05]
I thought Leo was different.
The Leo I knew would never
stoop this low...[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[END]

=== e | 1a678 | 178 ===
[POR09]
...Wait! The boy must
stay here with me.[BRK]

Take the others to the 
Destiny and wait for us
there.[BRK]

I will question the boy
privately.[BRK]

[POR00]
Lord Leo, are you sure you 
don't want one of us to
stay with you?[BRK]

[POR09]
Ha ha ha! Do you believe
that the mighty Lord Leo
can be overcome by a boy?[BRK]

Your comedic sensibility is
greater than I had imagined.[BRK]

I will be fine. Just leave
us now...[END]

=== f | 1a80c | 118 ===
[POR09]
Hiro, I have a question to
ask, and you must answer it
to the best of your ability.[BRK]

You've spent quite a bit of
time with Lucia during your
travels.[BRK]

And I believe that you know
Lucia better than anyone
in this world.[BRK]

Tell me, do you think that
Lucia is the foretold
destroyer?[END]

=== 10 | 1a928 | 2b ===
[0x5]Lucia is the destroyer.
Only once a month.[END]

=== 11 | 1a962 | 77 ===
[POR09]
Hiro! I'm not in the mood
for your sarcastic answers.[BRK]

I must have a straight
answer![BRK]

Our world hangs in the
balance![END]

=== 12 | 1a9ee | 1d2 ===
[POR01]
Leo, believe me when I tell
you that there is nothing
evil about Lucia.[BRK]

Her intentions are as pure
as the driven snow.[BRK]

[POR09]
Hmmm...That's what I've
begun to suspect.[BRK]

She does not seem to be a
threat to the good in our
world.[BRK]

But why must she meet with
the Goddess?[BRK]

It makes no sense to me...[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR09]
Hiro, you must tell me what
Lucia will do when she meets
the Goddess.[BRK]

You're her friend. She must
have told you...[BRK]

[POR00]
...Lord Leo, what are you 
doing here?[END]

=== 13 | 1abca | 13a ===
Entry into this tower is
strictly prohibited by
Althena's followers![BRK]

By what authority have you
come?[BRK]

[POR09]
I, Lord Leo, have come by
the authority of Althena
herself![BRK]

[POR00]
Lord Leo, if Althena truly
sent you, you would know
of our plans.[BRK]

Since you do not, I must
silence you once and for
all![BRK]

Magic beast...Come forth![END]

=== 14 | 1ad18 | a1 ===
[POR09]
...This...This makes no
sense...[BRK]

The members of Althena's
Cult seem to have gone wild![BRK]

I cannot believe that
Althena is involved, but
maybe Ronfar is right...[END]

=== 15 | 1add0 | 68 ===
[POR09]
Listen, Hiro, this time you
must give me a straight
answer.[BRK]

Tell me, is Lucia the
foretold destroyer?[END]

=== 16 | 1ae54 | 194 ===
[POR09]
What in the name of the
Goddess Althena is going on
in this place?[BRK]

[POR00]
Ha, ha, ha...You don't need
to trouble yourself with
those details, dear Leo.[BRK]

In fact, your time has
run out.[BRK]

Now that you know of our
secret scheme, we cannot
let you live.[BRK]

I have commanded hordes of
monsters into this tower
to eliminate you![BRK]

I'm sure that even with all
your power you will not 
survive![BRK]

Our secret dies with you![END]

=== 17 | 1b004 | c8 ===
Have you come to beg for
your very lives?[BRK]

I have no sympathy for you
now. Go...Face the fate
you have earned.[BRK]

[POR09]
Know this, cretin! When I
get out of here, you will
pay dearly for this![BRK]

I promise you![END]

=== 18 | 1b0e4 | 11c ===
[POR09]
...Hiro, if we are to
survive, we must put our
differences aside.[BRK]

If we work together, we
may be able to escape this
death trap.[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR09]
Know that it was not my
intention to drag you into
this mess.[BRK]

Pray that the Goddess is
with us, Hiro.[BRK]

Let's go...[BRK]

[POR02]
Here goes nothing![END]

Hiro, I believe I under-

Your combat skills are
most impressive.[BRK]

[POR02]
Yeah, Hiro! I think you're
even as good as Leo now![END]

Soldier, what happened?![BRK]

We...We fought.......
...But...it...wasn't...[BRK]

.....Sir...forgive me...[BRK]

[POR09]
What!?[BRK]

[POR02]
Just what we need![BRK]

was up, but I didn't know

indeed...[END]

They were relentless! I
couldn't stop them from
taking Lucia![BRK]

Only you have enough power
to stop them, Lord Leo.[END]
