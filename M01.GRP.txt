Ronfar:
I came to talk to you,
but nobody was home.[BRK]

I'll come back after
I finish work... 
                  LM[BRK]

[POR02]
See! The letter says
'Ronfar!' I was sure this
was his house...[BRK]

I wonder where he is?[END]

=== 1 | eb62 | e6 ===
Hello there, kiddies! You've
wandered a long way from
home to end up here![BRK]

Larpa's a great town, but
it's crawlin' with 
criminals, so be careful.[BRK]

In fact, you might want to
explore Dalton, to the west,
instead. It's much safer...[END]

=== 2 | ec5c | 83 ===
These freakin' soldiers
have no business bein'
here.[BRK]

Everyone in Larpa is a 
shyster, so who are they
protectin' us from, anyway?[END]

=== 3 | ecf2 | 81 ===
You're lookin' for a girl?[BRK]

Well, Larpa is not a good
place for a nice girl to
be lost...[BRK]

Hope ya find her...[BRK]

.......in one piece.[END]

=== 4 | ed82 | 69 ===
Ya know, even though this
joint is crawlin' with
seedy types...[BRK]

...it kinda grows on ya
after a while...[END]

=== 5 | edfe | 8f ===
We of Althena's Elite
Guard are looking for a
strange girl...[BRK]

Say...you look suspicious!
Her name's Lucia. She's not
a friend of yours, is she?[END]

=== 6 | eea0 | 7b ===
Stand back now! You're not
going anywhere, punks.[BRK]

We're under direct orders
from Lord Leo not to let
anyone suspicious out![END]

=== 7 | ef32 | 72 ===
There is a destroyer
disguised as a little girl
somewhere near here.[BRK]

If you see anything
suspicious, just call us.[END]

=== 8 | efbc | 9f ===
Hmmmm...A strange girl.
Say, miss...[BRK]

[POR02]
We, uh, we were just
leavin'. Nice talkin'
to ya...[BRK]

[POR00]
Well, geez! Sure, go ahead!
...Just blow me off. Lousy
brats...[END]

=== 9 | f074 | 5f ===
Ronfar? You're looking for
that miserable dog Ronfar?[BRK]

That low-life cheated me
out of my house![END]

=== a | f0d6 | 6a ===
I had the best view in all
western Larpa![BRK]

But that shameless pig 
tricked me into wagering
my whole house![END]

=== b | f158 | 9c ===
That dirtbag Ronfar always
talks about how he used to
be a priest.[BRK]

Priest, my butt! If he was a
priest, he'd have some com-
passion and return my house![END]

=== c | f208 | 9f ===
Althena's Guards try to keep
us from gambling because
it's bad for our souls...[BRK]

...or so they say.
Actually, we don't believe
them.[BRK]

...We just play in secret![END]

=== d | f2c4 | 79 ===
Are you looking for the
weird girl with the cool
red gown?[BRK]

I think she was the one I
saw caressing the grass and
flowers.[END]

=== e | f340 | 4d ===
The girl was staring at the
flowers like she'd never
seen one! What a kook...[END]

=== f | f3a4 | 3e ===
I'll never give up hope!
I will win my house back.
You'll see![END]

=== 10 | f3f0 | 112 ===
I think maybe I'll start
a chapter of Unrealistic
Gamblers Anonymous.[BRK]

Let's make this our first
meeting. I'll start.[BRK]

Okay...My name is Muerte,
and I'm a gamblaholic. Pity
me, and return my losses.[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, no! You're not draggin'
us into this mess! C'ya, ya
big retarded lug.[END]

=== 11 | f510 | aa ===
[POR05]
Wah haa haa! Sorry, old guy!
I ain't fallin' for that
trick![BRK]

It's the oldest trick in
my book. Nope, I ain't 
bitin', chumpy.[BRK]

The house is still mine,
fair and square![END]

=== 12 | f5d2 | 82 ===
I will get that house back!
In fact, I'm training to
be the world's best cheat![BRK]

It's the only way you can
win against that dynamo![END]

=== 13 | f662 | c0 ===
Just you wait, Ronfar! I've
learned enough tricks to win
back my house![BRK]

[POR02]
Shee! Give it up, already!
Ronfar is a much better
cheat than you'll ever be![BRK]

[POR00]
You won't be gettin' the
house back![END]

=== 14 | f73a | 31 ===
Oh, look! It's the famous
house-stealer of Larpa![END]

=== 15 | f778 | 76 ===
[POR05]
I didn't steal anything,
chumpo. I won your house
fair and square![BRK]

Get over it and move on with
your pathetic life![END]

=== 16 | f806 | a5 ===
Aaachoo! When Ronfar gets
back to his house,[BRK]

he's gotta find a way to
stop my cold![BRK]

This sneezing and itching
in my eyes is driving me
insane![BRK]

Aaa, aaa, aaaaachoooo![END]

=== 17 | f8c2 | 46 ===
Oh...Oh...nooooo....
Aaa...aah...Ronfar...
...Aachoooooooooooooo![END]

=== 18 | f91c | 87 ===
Hooo doggie! I'm plumb beat!
I...wish...I...could...sit![BRK]

Some stinking bozo stuck
liniment in my underpants![BRK]

I'm on fire! Ouh eee ahh![END]

=== 19 | f9ba | 97 ===
If I catch the prankster
that stuck this goop in my
shorts, I'll kill him![BRK]

I have a...sneaking...idea
it was Ronfar! Ahhhh! I'll
wring...his...neckkkk![END]

=== 1a | fa60 | 123 ===
Noooo, I'm not Ronfar. Too
bad, too. That guy's got
all the luck![BRK]

You're not from the tax
board, are you?[BRK]

[POR02]
Duh! Do we look like we're
from the tax board, 
Einstein?[BRK]

[POR00]
Well, okay, then. If you're
lookin for Ronfar, he's
probably at the bar.[BRK]

You know...gambling. Try
looking for him there.[END]

=== 1b | fb9a | cf ===
I thought you were looking
for Ronfar? I told you he
was at the bar...[BRK]

...What are you doin' back
here again?[BRK]

[POR02]
Hey, dipwad! We had to check
out your story, OK? We're
not amateurs, ya know![BRK]

Let's go, Hiro![END]

=== 1c | fc7c | 6e ===
Lord Leo was the last person
we'll see today. If you need
to do sanctuary business,[BRK]

please come back tomorrow.[END]

=== 1d | fcfe | 17d ===
[POR05]
Well, this is it! Home,
sweet home![BRK]

The girl's inside. Come on
in...[BRK]

Well now! What do we have
here...[BRK]

[POR00]
Ronfar:
I came to talk to you,
but nobody was home.[BRK]

I'll come back after
I finish work... 
                  LM[BRK]

[POR05]
Hmmm. This is certainly a
blast from the past. Wonder
when he's coming back?[BRK]

Oh well, I ain't losin' any
sleep over it. Come on in.
I'll show you the girl...[END]

=== 1e | fe8e | d ===
[POR05]
....
.....[END]

=== 1f | fea8 | 39 ===
[POR02]
Hmm, I wonder who 'LM' is?
We'd better stick around...[END]

=== 20 | fef8 | 7c ===
[POR02]
Lucia! We finally found you!
You should have never left
us![BRK]

Hiro and I were worried
sick![BRK]

...But you do look much
better.[END]

=== 21 | ff8c | 148 ===
[POR02]
Is that a good-bye? It
sounded just like a
good-bye...[BRK]

Where do you think you're
going, missy?[BRK]

[POR08]
Pentagulia. The holy city.[BRK]

I've learned that I can get
to Althena's city by means
of Dalton.[BRK]

So that is where my task
will lead me...[BRK]

[POR02]
Phoo! Dalton![BRK]

[POR08]
Good-bye, Hiro and Ruby.
Thank Gwyn and Ronfar for
me.[BRK]

[POR02]
B...But Lucia![END]

=== 22 | 100de | 89 ===
[POR02]
Sh-She's gone, Hiro.[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR02]
C'mon. At least we know
she's okay. Let's go back
to Grandpa's house.[BRK]

He must be worried by now.[END]

=== 23 | 1017e | 10 ===
[POR05]
Hey...Hiro![END]

=== 24 | 10198 | 1fb ===
[POR05]
Hey there! Just you and your
funny cat? Where's the
honey pot?[BRK]

The villagers are all talkin
'bout her, so she must be
around here somewhere.[BRK]

[POR02]
She went to Dalton.[BRK]

[POR05]
Dalton?![BRK]

Now, why'd she go and do a
dumb thing like that? The
Destiny's anchored there![BRK]

Leo's gotta be waiting for
her to walk into his trap![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh no! Hiro, what are we
gonna do now? Lucia's in
danger for sure![BRK]

[POR05]
I guess I'm part of this
little mess now.[BRK]

Tell you what. I'll go with
you to Dalton to see if I
can't straighten this out.[END]

=== 25 | 103ac | e0 ===
Hey...hey...I don't know
about that...Stop talking
to me! Get outta my head![BRK]

I don't wanna gamble against
Ronfar again...Shut up! Get
outta there, I said![BRK]

He used to be a priest! He
knows unholy tricks!...Get
off me...Ahhh![END]

=== 26 | 104a0 | e7 ===
R...Ronfar! It's you! H-How
did you know to come?...Shut
up! I can handle this...[BRK]

[POR05]
Say there, fella, have we
met? Can't say that I
remember ya.[BRK]

But I think a little
lithium might be just the
ticket for ya.[BRK]

...Check it out, bud.[END]

=== 27 | 1059e | ce ===
Yeah, there was a girl with
a red gown that came through
here....Stop it! Right now![BRK]

...She was asking all sorts
of...Get off him, idiot!...
strange questions.[BRK]

I say the chick's kinda
nuts, if you ask me...[END]

=== 28 | 10688 | 45 ===
Lucia was the girl's name.
...Yes, bat breath! I know
who they are...[END]

=== 29 | 106e0 | 53 ===
That nutty girl named...Hey!
Who's in charge here?!!...
Lucia went toward the pier.[END]

=== 2a | 1074a | 119 ===
Hey, mister. Ya got a little
change? I gotta buy some uh
that lithium...[BRK]

These voices are....I saaaid
shuuutt up!...driving me
completely insane![BRK]

Ya got any spare change?[BRK]

[POR05]
Nope. Can't say that I do.
Try the free clinic, bud.[BRK]

The goddess helps those that
help themselves, ya know.[END]

=== 2b | 1087a | aa ===
Hey there! What happened to
that Ronfar guy?[BRK]

Did he go back to gambling
the...Aah, I know, that,
idiot!...day away?[BRK]

I knew he would. That fellow
is sick. He needs help...[END]

=== 2c | 10934 | ee ===
The other day I was walking
by the lake and I heard this
weird noise...[BRK]

It was...[BRK]

Shut up! I know what I'm
doing!...[BRK]

....it was sorta like
garba garba goom goom...[BRK]

...Came from the direction
of the Dragon Ruins. Kinda
scary, if ya ask me.[END]

=== 2d | 10a36 | af ===
Hey there. Can ya lend a
guy down on his luck 
100 Silver?[BRK]

I got a foolproof tip on a
horse in the seventh! It's
gonna make me rich![BRK]

I just need some money to
place the bet...[END]

=== 2e | 10afc | a0 ===
Tell ya what...Give me the
100s and I'll pay you 1000s
when my horse comes in![BRK]

[POR02]
C'mon, get real! We're not
throwing our money away by
giving it to some drunk![END]

=== 2f | 10bb0 | 6c ===
Those stupid priests of the
sanctuary...What are they
thinking?[BRK]

The only destroyers here
are the bookmakers.[END]

=== 30 | 10c30 | cd ===
Some strange girl just came
by here. When I asked her
for money, she just stared.[BRK]

So I said 'You know, cash,
Silver, bread, dough, gravy, 
wampum...?'[BRK]

And all she did was stare.
It gave me the creeps, man![END]

=== 31 | 10d10 | 80 ===
Hey...Hey you! Come here.
I've got a business
proposition for ya...[BRK]

If ya lend me 100s, I'll
pay ya back 1000s with my
winnings![END]

=== 32 | 10d9e | 5f ===
[POR05]
What the heck are you
talking about?[BRK]

No gamble is a sure thing![BRK]

...Well, unless I'm playing.[END]

=== 33 | 10e0c | 6b ===
Damn! I lost the money I
bet against you beating
the boss![BRK]

How are you going to make
it up to me? Hmm? Hmm?[END]

=== 34 | 10e84 | 4c ===
[POR09]
You pathetic fool! Start
taking some responsibility
for your own actions![END]

=== 35 | 10ee0 | 75 ===
Hello, adventurers! Welcome
to Larpa! Have you been to
our fair city before?
[0x5]Yes, you chiseler!
No, can you help us?[END]

=== 36 | 10f64 | 81 ===
Ah, ha ha ha! Well then,
you're on to my little
tricks...[BRK]

Keep it under your hat,
okay? I think I see some
new folk over there...[END]

=== 37 | 10ff6 | 16a ===
Oh, I'd be happy to show
you the ropes.[BRK]

The people of Larpa are all
fair and honest. They have
come here from all over.[BRK]

We have a long tradition of
clean and wholesome life.[BRK]

Visitors are required to pay
a 1000s gift to the city.[BRK]

The funds collected are used
to care for the sick and
aged.[BRK]

I am the designated visitor
fee collector. I'll happily
accept your gift.[END]

=== 38 | 11174 | 7b ===
Once you've been to Larpa,
you'll never gamble any-
place else.[BRK]

Say, if you need any cash,
I'll buy the flying cat
for 10s![END]

=== 39 | 11206 | cf ===
Say, do you know that
freaky chick in the red
robe?[BRK]

She's wandering around here
talking about the Blue Star
and some crisis...[BRK]

The babe's completely out
of touch with reality. Says
some 'Hiro' guy knows her.[END]

=== 3a | 112f0 | 52 ===
The Blue Star in crisis?
I keep hearing about it, [BRK]

but I don't know what it
means.[END]

=== 3b | 11356 | 8f ===
They say that Althena came
from the Blue Star, but I
don't believe it.[BRK]

[POR02]
You know, we're starting to
think there's some truth
to that rumor...[END]

=== 3c | 113f4 | 7d ===
If ya got any problems
that need fixin', come
to me.[BRK]

My work is good, and my
fees are just right! Only
5000s a day! Ha ha ha![END]

=== 3d | 1147e | 6f ===
Sorry, folks, I'm off-duty.
I got a few gamblin' dates
to keep.[BRK]

[POR02]
Don't you ever get sick of
gambling? Sheesh![END]

=== 3e | 11504 | 94 ===
Hooommhh, where are all the
good men these days?[BRK]

The only thing the boys
around here want to do is
gamble.[BRK]

Well, I'm tellin' you, I
have needs, too![END]

=== 3f | 115b0 | 49 ===
This town is nothing but
a big never-never land for
lost boys...pathetic![END]

=== 40 | 11610 | bf ===
Say there, Ronfar, why
don't you quit the gambling
and settle down?[BRK]

I could make it very worth
your while, pumpkin...[BRK]

[POR05]
What?! Geez, uh, sorry.
I don't need to settle
down, little desperado.[END]

=== 41 | 116ea | b5 ===
C'mon, Ronfar! I wanna
have your baby.[BRK]

Let's settle down and play
house...[BRK]

[POR05]
Sorry, sugar bumps, I gotta
be free. Can't tie my boat
to only one dock, ya know.[BRK]

Nothing personal.[END]

=== 42 | 117b2 | 99 ===
You just missed the show![BRK]

Some girl came by here
singing to herself and
staring into the sky.[BRK]

She seemed so innocent...
and yet no one knew who
she was.[END]

=== 43 | 1185e | 41 ===
Larpa is free, and the
air is sweet today. It's
good to be alive![END]

=== 44 | 118ac | b8 ===
Say, Ronfar...I heard you
gave up being a gambler.
What happened?[BRK]

[POR05]
Heard wrong, sugar plum.
I'm an unholy roller, with
luck that won't quit![BRK]

I ain't quittin' 'til I'm
six feet under![END]

=== 45 | 11978 | 5b ===
Say, Ronfar, have ya decided
to settle down and play
house?[BRK]

I'm waiting for the day,
hunky![END]

=== 46 | 119e6 | 82 ===
Well, it looks like your
latest gamble turned out
okay...You won your life![BRK]

[POR05]
Don't talk like that...
you're making my back
itch![END]

=== 47 | 11a7c | b0 ===
That sanctuary is to the
Goddess Althena.[BRK]

Some say that the end of 
the world is at hand. I
think they're right...[BRK]

I don't know if even the
Goddess Althena herself
can save us![END]

=== 48 | 11b44 | 37 ===
You know, I'm not sure
the Goddess Althena even
exists.[END]

=== 49 | 11b8e | 8e ===
The sanctuary priests tell
us that Althena can save
us from the world's end.[BRK]

I don't really think the
Goddess even watches over
us any more...[END]

=== 4a | 11c34 | 79 ===
The girl with the red
robe?[BRK]

Was that the one that looked
so very sad?[BRK]

It seemed like she had just
lost her best friend...[END]

=== 4b | 11cc8 | 65 ===
If you hurry, maybe you can
catch up to her and cheer
her up.[BRK]

[POR02]
I just hope we can find
her again...[END]

=== 4c | 11d40 | 84 ===
The people of Larpa don't
really like to have their
actions dictated.[BRK]

The priests of Althena with
their rules make many of
them mad.[END]

=== 4d | 11dde | a1 ===
It's tough to get the
people here to follow
Althena...[BRK]

They don't want to give
up their gambling...[BRK]

And besides, the priests
of Althena are all crooked
anyway...[END]

=== 4e | 11e82 | 72 ===
It's not like the people
here don't like Althena.[BRK]

They just don't believe in
anything except the power
of chance.[END]

=== 4f | 11f08 | 84 ===
Say there, sweetie. You
look like you're looking
for someone. Need any help?
[0x5]Yes, I'm looking for Ronfar.
No, I know my way around.[END]

=== 50 | 11f9c | a0 ===
Well, you won't find him in
the sanctuary, that's for
sure![BRK]

He traded the cloth for the
dice.[BRK]

Check out the alleys and
bars. The bum's probably in
another game.[END]

=== 51 | 1204c | 14 ===
Well, suit yourself.[END]

=== 52 | 12064 | 12 ===
Good luck, then...[END]

=== 53 | 1208e | 5b ===
Man, if playing sick is all
it takes to get Ronfar's
attention...[BRK]

...then call me terminal![END]

=== 54 | 12100 | 83 ===
Ronfar! You've given up
gambling! That's great![BRK]

[POR05]
Whoa there! I haven't given
up anything. I just have
some business to attend to.[END]

=== 55 | 12196 | 3e ===
The air is clear and the
sun is bright.[BRK]

It's good to be alive![END]

=== 56 | 121e8 | d8 ===
Starting another journey,
Ronfar, my dear?[BRK]

[POR05]
Yep! Now you behave while
I'm gone. I want you nice
and rested when I get back.[BRK]

[POR02]
What? So you can be your
normal chauvinistic pig and
give her a workout?[BRK]

Oh, please...[END]

=== 57 | 122d4 | e4 ===
You know, just between you
and me, the best looking
man here is Ronfar![BRK]

He's just good enough to
eat![BRK]

And control! When the dice
are in his hands, it's
almost like magic![BRK]

[POR02]
Yeah, right...Magic. I'm
so impressed, I'm yawning...[END]

=== 58 | 123d0 | ac ===
Ohhh, Ronfar, you're
just the dreamiest...[BRK]

Drop those dice and work
your magic on me, baby.[BRK]

[POR05]
Well, honey bomb, winky says
yes, but thinky says I
gotta get to work. Sorry.[END]

=== 59 | 12498 | 8f ===
Oh Ronfar, my knees are
weak...[BRK]

You little devil. You're
working your magic on
my heart...[BRK]

[POR05]
Hey...Don't blame me if
you're easy, sweetcheeks.[END]

=== 5a | 1253e | 6e ===
It's so maddening! I see
Ronfar every day,[BRK]

but I can't get him to 
commit to anything more
than a cheap fling![END]

=== 5b | 125c4 | bb ===
Oh, Ronfar, my heart is
yours![BRK]

[POR05]
Are you still on that kick?
I told you! I have a girl-
friend now![BRK]

...Get it?[BRK]

[POR00]
Well then, let me be your
dice. Lay your hands on
these lucky bones...[END]

=== 5c | 1268c | 44 ===
[POR09]
Ronfar! Father said you'd
never change, and I guess
he was right![END]

=== 5d | 126ec | 47 ===
Ronfar...sweetie...please
reconsider. I could be your
biggest win yet.[END]

=== 5e | 1275a | 196 ===
What in tarnation is that
freaky red thing flapping
over your shoulder, boy?[BRK]

[POR02]
Hey! Who you calling freaky,
goober?![BRK]

I'm a Red Dragon, and you 
better show me some respect,
or I'll toast your hide![BRK]

[POR00]
Wah haa hah! I didn't know
Red Dragons were now coming
in bite-sized packages![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, really? Well have you
ever seen a 'bite-sized'
package do this?[BRK]

[POR00]
Ooooouuuuch![BRK]

Hey! You burned me, you
little runt!!![END]

=== 5f | 1291c | b7 ===
[POR02]
Now then, what do you have
to say for yourself, pig?[BRK]

[POR00]
Well, you can blow fire,
all right, ya lousy furry
lizard...[BRK]

[POR02]
What did you say?[BRK]

[POR00]
Oh...uh...nothing...[BRK]

Nice day, huh?[END]

=== 60 | 129fe | 4d ===
Okay, okay, I got the point.
The little one there can 
blow fire...big whoop.[END]

=== 61 | 12a5e | 120 ===
A while ago, I was takin'
a leak in that alley, and
this girl came up to watch![BRK]

Can you believe that? She
just sat there staring!
I was totally embarrassed![BRK]

[POR02]
That's what you get for
leaking the lizard outside
in a city, idiot![BRK]

Didn't anyone ever show
you how to use a toilet?
...Sheesh![END]

=== 62 | 12b92 | ab ===
Ya know, there's a circus
around here that'd pay top
dollar for your, uh, dragon.[BRK]

[POR02]
Hey, buster! Hiro would
never sell me to be a circus

Uh, right, Hiro?[END]

=== 63 | 12c50 | 10c ===
Ya know, I've heard that
dragon toes are absolutely
delicious.[BRK]

You wouldn't be in the
mood to spare a couple,
would you?...I'll pay![BRK]

[POR02]
Are you kidding? I can't
believe you asked that!
Take this!!![BRK]

[POR00]
Ooooooooouuuuch![BRK]

Hey! You burned me again,
you little freak!!![END]

=== 64 | 12d74 | 6e ===
N-N-Now you just stay
away from me! I don't
want any more trouble![BRK]

I'm still recovering from
that last burn![END]

Larpa Village[END]

I'll find that girl for the
Goddess, if it's the last
thing I do![BRK]

We won't allow her to ruin
all we've built![END]

=== 67 | 14ba4 | 9e ===
Lord Leo, you certainly
look splendid today, if I
might offer my opinion.[BRK]

I don't usually say that

You know...the oath, and all

Okay. Now then, everything
is set to break the spell
on Lucia.[BRK]

Goddess Althena, hear my
plea...Take your holy light
and cleanse this girl.[BRK]

Loose the bonds that now
bind the mind and heart of
this tortured soul.[BRK]

Shatter the darkness with
rays of holy light!!![END]

=== 6b | 14dca | dd ===
[POR08]
Uuu...Aaaahhhh![BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar! What's wrong? 
Lucia's in agony![BRK]

[POR05]
This is impossible! The
spell she's under is 
stronger than...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I-I've never failed to 
break a spell, except once
when...[BRK]

....Mauri was sick...[END]

=== 6c | 14eb0 | 92 ===
[POR05]
Ohhhh...yes! It...It worked![BRK]

...Sweet success at the
hands of Ronfar![BRK]

It's not complete, but the
main spell is broken. She'll
just have to...[END]

=== 6d | 14f4c | fc ===
Oh! I didn't know anyone
was still in here.[BRK]

Yes, well, the sanctuary is
closed for the day. Come 
back tomorrow...[BRK]

[POR05]
No thanks, old man. I don't
have any need to come back
to this place.[BRK]

Lucia, you can rest at my 
house with your friends. 
Let's go...[END]

=== 6e | 15066 | 39 ===
Are you still trying to
break the curse on the
poor girl?[END]

=== 6f | 150a2 | 60 ===
The Goddess is good to those
that serve her well...[BRK]

[POR02]
Especially if they donate in
cash, right?[END]

=== 70 | 1511a | 5e ===
Please donate your spare
money to the sanctuary. [BRK]

Althena will reward your
generosity someday.[END]

=== 71 | 1518c | b6 ===
The sanctuary is still
closed for the day.[BRK]

Please come back later.[BRK]

[POR05]
C'mon, Hiro. Let's go to
my house and let Lucia 
rest.[BRK]

She's had a really tough
time, and I'm sure she needs
it.[END]

=== 72 | 1526a | 88 ===
Thanks be to Althena, the
Goddess from which all
goodness springs forth...[BRK]

But goodness has a price to
be paid...Donate now, won't
you?[END]

=== 73 | 15316 | 74 ===
I now know that the Goddess
cannot fix all of mankind's
mistakes.[BRK]

We must take responsibility
for our own actions...[END]

=== 74 | 1539a | 8a ===
The most important thing we
all must possess is a
willing spirit.[BRK]

The goddess will not help
those that are not willing
to help themselves.[END]

=== 75 | 15438 | c4 ===
You're looking for the girl
with red clothes?[BRK]

If you pray to Althena, and
your heart is true, she will
show you the way, I'm sure.[BRK]

The best way to show that
your heart is true is to
donate freely.[END]

=== 76 | 15510 | 9d ===
The people of this town
are deserving only of
Althena's wrath![BRK]

All they want to do is
gamble their lives away![BRK]

And they never donate any
of their winnings...[END]

=== 77 | 155bc | 72 ===
We've worked so hard to
build a peaceful, loving
world here.[BRK]

But it's come so close to
destruction so many
times![END]

=== 78 | 1563c | 53 ===
[POR09]
As long as the Goddess is
yet with us, Zophar will not
accomplish his evil here.[END]

=== 79 | 156a2 | 129 ===
Ah, yes. I sense that the
girl in the red robe is
fading from us.[BRK]

Quick--donate to Althena
and pray for her mercy.[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, I really don't think
that's gonna work...[BRK]

Say, do you happen to
know a priest named Ronfar?[BRK]

[POR00]
Priest?!? Ronfar is no
priest!![BRK]

He has traded his calling
for implements of sin.[END]

=== 7a | 157e2 | 4b ===
That miserable failure,
Ronfar, could have been the
greatest priest of all.[END]

=== 7b | 15854 | 5e ===
Our world now careens toward
destruction...[BRK]

Only the Goddess Althena has
the power to save us.[END]

=== 7c | 158c2 | 42 ===
I can't believe that our
world was saved from the
brink by humans.[END]

=== 7d | 15912 | 49 ===
[POR05]
Now you can get to more
important jobs...like
learning to shoot craps![END]

=== 7e | 1596a | 70 ===
These miserable souls do
not understand the danger
our world is in.[BRK]

If they did, they'd be
crying like babies...[END]

=== 7f | 159ee | 77 ===
Lucia? No, I can't say that
I know of her.[BRK]

Say, can I interest you in
becoming a member of the
Sanctuary Boosters Club?[END]

=== 80 | 15a88 | bc ===
Say, can I cut you a deal
on a slightly used Althena
statue?[BRK]

They make great hall trees!
Attractive and functional.[BRK]

With the world going to hell
in a handbasket, we don't
need 'em anymore.[END]

=== 81 | 15b52 | 78 ===
[POR05]
Say there, sis, don't beat
yourself up about it.[BRK]

Trot on over to the bar and
forget your worries over a
cold one![END]

=== 82 | 15bde | 74 ===
Since the Goddess Althena
herself resides in Penta-
gulia, [BRK]

only specially chosen ones
may enter its hallowed
halls.[END]

=== 83 | 15c60 | 30 ===
[POR08]
...Althena resides in...
Pentagulia...Hmm....[END]

=== 84 | 15c94 | 3f ===
I'm dreaming of the day I am
chosen to serve in Penta-
gulia...[END]

=== 85 | 15cea | 6c ===
There's a rumor floating
around about that dog
Ronfar.[BRK]

They say he's been learning
new tricks in Pentagulia![END]

=== 86 | 15d64 | 75 ===
[POR05]
Hrmph! Well, it's not true,
but I kinda like the sound
of it.[BRK]

Kinda enhances my special
mystique, don't you think?[END]

=== 87 | 15df0 | d7 ===
Huh? A girl wearing a red
dress? No, I haven't seen
her.[BRK]

But rather than chasing
skirts, why not repent from
your sins and serve Althena?[BRK]

[POR05]
Done it, seen it, been it.
Sorry, no dice...[BRK]

Uh, pardon the pun...Hahaha![END]

=== 88 | 15eea | 6c ===
If Zophar had succeeded,
our world would have been
lost forever![BRK]

Thank heavens for the
heroes that saved us![END]

=== 89 | 15f66 | 47 ===
If you offer your Silver
to the Goddess Althena, 
you will grow strong.[END]

=== 8a | 15fc0 | a4 ===
Some of the village folk
give to the sanctuary,[BRK]

but most are heathen pigs
who will wither in the hot
fires of Althena's fury.[BRK]

At least, I'm pretty sure
they will...[END]

=== 8b | 16074 | 6f ===
You can ask Althena to do
anything on your behalf.[BRK]

But it's really just good
manners to donate something,
too.[END]

=== 8c | 160fc | 7e ===
We are the guardians of
Althena's truth.[BRK]

Through us, the world will
come to know Althena's
goodness.[BRK]

...If they donate enough.[END]

=== 8d | 1617e | 69 ===
But in all this time, we
have not made even one
person here convert![BRK]

This town is crawlin' with
sinners![END]

=== 8e | 161fe | ad ===
Lucia...Lucia...hmm...[BRK]

I have heard that name once
before. I think Lord Leo was
trying to find her.[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh no! I don't like the
sound of that one bit! We've
got to find her![END]

=== 8f | 162be | 88 ===
I was thinking of starting
a bingo tournament to pack
this place.[BRK]

Do you think it'll work?
Of course, all proceeds will
go to Althena...[END]

=== 90 | 16354 | 8a ===
[POR05]
Hey, that sounds like just
the ticket to get the 
sinners in here![BRK]

Come right down to their
level. At least, that's
what I always said.[END]

=== 91 | 163f8 | 32 ===
Whatever happened to the
carefree days of before?[END]

=== 92 | 1642e | 79 ===
If there's one thing I've
learned through all of this,
it's this:[BRK]

Believe in yourself and all
your dreams will come true.[END]

=== 93 | 164b0 | f ===
Larpa Sanctuary[END]

=== 94 | 172be | 7f ===
Well, hello there! Sit down
and take a load off those
tired feet![BRK]

The girl doesn't look too
well...Why don't you have 
a drink?[END]

=== 95 | 17350 | b6 ===
You say you're looking for
Ronfar?[BRK]

Hrmph! Well, he's a pretty
secretive guy. Maybe he
doesn't want to be bothered.[BRK]

But if you want to take
your chances, he's at the
back of the bar.[END]

=== 96 | 1741a | 8d ===
Oh my! Did you see that?
The girl in red just...just
...collapsed![BRK]

[POR02]
She's under some sort of
curse. We're trying to get
Ronfar to break it![END]

=== 97 | 174ba | a5 ===
What? You're looking for the
cute girl that was with you
before?[BRK]

I haven't seen her recently,
but I sure hope she's not
sick anymore...[BRK]

[POR02]
Thanks for nothing, chump.[END]

=== 98 | 17572 | a7 ===
This bar is the best place
in the world to relax after
a long hard day.[BRK]

And if you're in the mood,
you can lose all your money
here as well![BRK]

We're a full-service bar![END]

=== 99 | 17628 | 74 ===
C'mon now! Take a bit of
time to refresh your souls
with food and drink![BRK]

...And a game of cards,
if you're up to it![END]

=== 9a | 176b6 | 37 ===
Right now, I'm just a lousy,
stinking bar wench, but...[END]

One day my knight in shining
armor will ride through
those doors...[BRK]

And sweep me off to a new 
life with shimmering palaces
and dazzling wealth...[BRK]

Uh, I think you'd better lay
off the romance novels for
a while, sister...[BRK]

Fabio ain't comin' for ya,
I'm sorry to say...[END]

I think my friend Urvin
is going to propose to
me...[BRK]

But he's just a poor street
vendor. If he does, I don't
know what I'll do...[BRK]

What should I do? Should I
give up on my dream or hold
out for what may never come?[END]

=== 9d | 178fa | 4a ===
I'm so confused! Why is it
that it never works like
this in fairy tales...[END]

=== 9e | 17958 | 84 ===
I've made up my mind. I'll
marry Urvin and make the
best life possible with him.[BRK]

It will be tough. But at
least I know he loves me.[END]

=== 9f | 179f8 | 8e ===
I've been coming here for
years just to stare at
Martha over there.[BRK]

But she still thinks I
just want to be friends.[BRK]

Well, dammit! I want more![END]

=== a0 | 17aa6 | be ===
I can't begin to express
the depth of my love for
Martha.[BRK]

She is the desert rose that
gives hope to the parched
wasteland of my heart.[BRK]

The...The ying in my yang.
The only one I'll ever love![END]

If only I could find a way
to make Martha understand.[BRK]

She must see me not for the
lowly street vendor I am,
but as a man who loves her![END]

Well, I've done it now.
I've gone and proposed to
Martha.[BRK]

Cat's out of the bag now.
I hope she finds it in her
heart to love me too...[END]

Tell ya what.[BRK]

If you win, I'll give you
my house.[BRK]

But if I win, I get your
little flying cat-thing.[BRK]

I'm sure I can find some

Ha! Well, beat it! And

rolling the bones...[END]

Or you can try again...
[0x5]I think I need to.
No, I know when I'm beat.[END]

Lousy, stinking cheat![BRK]

I know he was cheating,

Haven't you figured out that

You can give 'em to her

Delicious, sweet fruit for

Oh Ronfar, plant a warm,

I told her that the mayor

Is that true?[BRK]

Oh well, no matter. I'll

I'd love to, but I got some

I'll catch ya later. Okay,

Hey, kid! Don't bother me

If I lose my concentration,

So, beat it![END]

C'mon, Ronfar, it's been so

That girl who was with you

I'll tell you, I wanted to

What kind of a nitwit would

I don't care if the world is

Oh! So you've met my over-

Leo to get hold of her.[BRK]

You stay here. I'll go see

Some little brat called
Hiro tricked me and helped
a destroyer.[BRK]

I had no idea that it would
come disguised as a girl.
That was my mistake.[BRK]

I won't make it again.[BRK]

A girl, huh...You say she's
a...destroyer??[BRK]

[POR01]
...Come on, Ronfar, don't
spill the beans...[BRK]

[POR02]
This is not good, Hiro. If
he talks, we're all dead
meat![BRK]

[POR09]
Well, Ronfar, if you hear
anything about this girl
at one of your games,[BRK]

let me know, okay?[BRK]

[POR05]

Uh...ahem...Right! Haven't
heard anything,[BRK]

[POR09]
Well, I guess that's all I
can do today. [BRK]

Tomorrow, I'll start the
search anew. That brat will

Ronfar, why don't you return
to Pentagulia and the
service of Althena?[BRK]

You know, Mauri never got
over you leaving. She still
asks about you...[END]

=== e4 | 1aca6 | 19f ===
[POR05]
C'mon, Leo! We've been down
that road a zillion times![BRK]

You've got to tell Mauri to
forget all about me.[BRK]

I'm a loser...a has-been.
She's too good for me.[BRK]

[POR09]
....
.....[BRK]

Ronfar, you're much too hard
on yourself. You did the
best you could.[BRK]

And even though you couldn't
save her, she still managed
to survive...[BRK]

Forget about the past and
come back to Pentagulia...

You know, back in Penta-

friend in the world.[BRK]

We were like brothers.[BRK]

I lied to him. And just
for you, stranger.[BRK]

But I lied on a hunch that
you are doing what you think
is right...[BRK]

I can see it in your eyes.
You don't believe the girl
is a destroyer at all.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I was like you...a young
kid fired up with ambition.
And then...[BRK]

...Oh, Mauri...I miss her so
much![BRK]

But that's foolish talk. All
that matters now is my dice,
and lucky they are![BRK]

Okay, Hiro, here's the deal.
Play the dice and win, and
I'll help you and Lucia.[BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro, forget about it! His
dice have gotta be loaded![BRK]

[POR05]
Ah, Ruby, you're tearing my
heart to shreds! Me? A 
cheat? C'mon...[BRK]

Just one round. My heart's
in the right place. So 
what is it, odd or even?
[0x5]I think I'll go for even.
I'd better take odds.[END]

Hiro, you won! I don't
believe it![BRK]

[POR05]
Well, luck certainly must be
with you today! I'm yours on
a toss of the dice...[BRK]

To break the spell, we'll
have to use a statue of
the Goddess.[BRK]

There's one in the
sanctuary.[BRK]

But Leo's got that guarded,
so we'd better use the back
door. C'mon, this way...[END]

right into the sanctuary.[BRK]

Hiro, you bring Lucia.[END]

He tried so hard to break
the spell...He must have

Maybe I'll ask him when
he wakes up...[BRK]

One thing's for sure: He's
got a heart of gold under
that thick skin...[END]

But...what else can we
do, Lucia?[BRK]

Can you hear me?[BRK]

You are my...only chance.[END]

You don't have to worry.
Lucia's life is not in
danger anymore.[BRK]

But only Althena's pure
power can restore what
Lucia lost to the spell.[BRK]

Whew! I forgot how hard this
priest stuff was! I need to
get some sleep.[BRK]

I'd suggest that you guys
do the same. There's a long
road ahead.[BRK]

Lucia, you can take my bed,
and the rest of you can
sleep where you want.[END]

try to help you...if you can
pay the price.[BRK]

But don't ask me about this
'Ronfar' fellow, because I
honestly don't know him.[END]

=== 13b | 204b8 | 97 ===
Hey, Ronfar, I'm keeping my
end of our little bargain.[BRK]

I'll keep giving vague
answers to everyone that
asks about you...[BRK]

At least until my debt's
paid.[END]

=== 13c | 2056a | fe ===
Say there, Ronfar. Are you
cheating again? You know,
that's a capital offense...[BRK]

[POR05]
Chief! I'm shocked that you
would even say that to me![BRK]

You yourself know what a
fine, upstanding citizen I
am in this community...[BRK]

Why would you say such a
hurtful thing?[END]

=== 13d | 2067c | 148 ===
Say, aren't you guys friends
of that Lucia girl?[BRK]

Don't try to deny it, I saw
you with her! Anyway, she
wanted some information,[BRK]

so I told her how to get to
Pentagulia by way of a ship
in Dalton.[BRK]

Then the crazy girl split
without paying my
information fee![BRK]

But now that you're here,
I'll get it from you! It
was 30s. So pay up![END]

=== 13e | 207da | 3a ===
Well, I guess if you
haven't got 30s, this'll
have to do.[END]

=== 13f | 20846 | 1e ===
Thanks. Now get outta 
here...[END]

=== 140 | 20868 | 5f ===
What? Where did that girl
go?[BRK]

She said she wanted to see
a sandship and headed to
the harbor...[END]

=== 141 | 208de | d3 ===
Is that Lucia some spoiled
little rich girl?[BRK]

When I asked her for payment
she just stared at me like
I was from another planet.[BRK]

It kinda gave me the creeps.
Anyway, she went toward the
harbor. Have you seen her?[END]

=== 142 | 20a04 | 1a ===
Thanks for the tip, Chief![END]

=== 143 | 20a38 | 84 ===
I quit selling information.
My wife was complaining too
much about my crazy hours.[BRK]

She wants me just to be the
mayor, and that's it.[END]

=== 144 | 20ac0 | 4c ===
Maybe my wife is right. I
think I'll concentrate on
just being a good mayor.[END]

=== 145 | 20b24 | ca ===
This gambler's town is no
place to raise a child![BRK]

Our daughter needs schooling
and friends, but this town
is nothing but scoundrels.[BRK]

I wish my husband would
clean this town up. After
all, he is mayor...[END]

=== 146 | 20c06 | 117 ===
Say, just keep away from
our daughter. [BRK]

You look like another bad
influence, and I'm telling
you, she doesn't need it![BRK]

She's got several out-of-
town suitors, and I don't
want her chances ruined.[BRK]

She's gonna marry and get
out of this town if it
kills me![BRK]

[POR02]
Uh...is she serious?[END]

=== 147 | 20d30 | 9f ===
Oh, who am I kidding? Our
daughter is dumb as a post
and ugly as sin.[BRK]

What idiot would want to
marry her?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Uh, that's just between
you and me, okay?[END]

=== 148 | 20de2 | 72 ===
All the girls in this town
these days are loose.[BRK]

Our daughter won't be like
them! She'll get a man with
her charm.[END]

=== 149 | 20e62 | 52 ===
[POR07]
Whew! With looks like that,
she better be the most
charming girl on the planet![END]

=== 14a | 20ec8 | 105 ===
No, no, no! Get out of
here this minute![BRK]

You're that weird girl who
came here and broke every
dish in the house![BRK]

[POR08]
I'm...I'm very sorry. When
I first came here I was...
well...clumsy.[BRK]

[POR02]
Give the girl a break! She
didn't do any permanent
damage, butt-breath![END]

=== 14b | 20ff4 | 105 ===
Ooohh! Aren't you the brave,
strong lad that defeated
Zophar?[BRK]

Our daughter would make an
excellent wife for you.
Come...I'll introduce you.[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, Hiro...Take my word on
this...You do not want to
meet this...this...[BRK]

(and I'm using the term
very loosely)...girl.[END]

=== 14c | 21110 | f0 ===
Hiro, you're a nice lad.
You must know the value
of inner beauty.[BRK]

Our daughter has all her
beauty on the inside,
hidden for you to discover.[BRK]

Say, if you'll marry her,
I'll pay for the wedding
and set you up in a house![BRK]

Pretty please...???[END]

=== 14d | 21214 | 4a ===
Duh, whull lookee here!

[POR05]
These? Oh, they're called
dice. I use them to create
money, little lady.[BRK]

[POR02]
'Create money', baah![BRK]

Make it disappear is closer
to the real story...[END]

=== 14f | 21348 | 91 ===

[POR02]

One day mah prince will come

=== 153 | 215a4 | b6 ===
Those kooks from the Cult
of Althena came to town and
set up shop recently.[BRK]

All they do is beg for money
to make bigger shrines![BRK]

Geez! I didn't think that
was what Althena was about![END]

=== 154 | 21672 | 6d ===
No, I don't want to talk
about those weirdoes from
the Cult of Althena.[BRK]

All it does is get me in a
bad mood. [END]

=== 155 | 216f2 | 9e ===
I taught the new girl how
to gamble, and now she's
a money machine![BRK]

The girl can't lose![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh no! He's gotta be talking
about Lucia! We've got to
find her...[END]

=== 156 | 217a4 | da ===
The culties have been making
a big fuss lately, saying
our world's end is near.[BRK]

It's really starting to get
on my nerves.[BRK]

I can't stop thinking about
twisting their pointy little
heads off...[BRK]

That's just not like me...[END]

=== 157 | 21892 | 87 ===
I think the followers of
Althena have really changed.[BRK]

I'm giving them the benefit
of the doubt, now that they
seem to be trying harder.[END]

=== 158 | 21930 | 4e ===
Since the fake Althena was
exposed, the Culties have
turned into real priests![END]

=== 159 | 21996 | 9d ===
My boss is a pretty greedy
guy. He wants money for
everything he does.[BRK]

He's got this town tied up
on his little pinky.[BRK]

But don't tell him I said
that, okay?[END]

=== 15a | 21a4e | 102 ===
I never argue with the boss.
He's kinda temperamental
sometimes.[BRK]

...Oops, I called him 'boss.'
He don't like that too much.[BRK]

It's a habit from the old
days...before he bought the
election...[BRK]

Whoop! Look what I gone and
done...Don't repeat what I
jus' told ya![END]

=== 15b | 21b6c | 49 ===
Da boss...uh, mayor, is

Go right ahead an' go in.[END]

=== 15c | 21bc8 | 77 ===
The mayor is in a bad mood
right now. I'd stay away
if I was you...[BRK]

...Just a tip, not that I
care what yooz do wit it.[END]

=== 15d | 21c52 | 9f ===
What are yooz doing? Paying
another woman's debt?[BRK]

That's not too smart, my
friend. But, hey, just a
piece of advice...[BRK]

...not that I care what 
yooz do wit it.[END]

=== 15e | 21d14 | 30 ===
The mayor is in the next

Go right on in...[END]
