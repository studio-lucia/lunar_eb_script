Ronfar:
i came to talk to you,
but nobody was home.[BRK]

I'll come back after
i finish work... 
                  lm[BRK]

[POR02]
See! The letter says
'ronfar!' I was sure this
was his house...[BRK]

I wonder where he is?[END]

=== 1 | eb62 | e6 ===
Hello there, kiddies! You've
wandered a long way from
home to end up here![BRK]

Larpa's a great town, but
it's crawlin' with 
criminals, so be careful.[BRK]

In fact, you might want to
explore dalton, to the west,
instead. It's much safer...[END]

=== 2 | ec5c | 83 ===
These freakin' soldiers
have no business bein'
here.[BRK]

Everyone in larpa is a 
shyster, so who are they
protectin' us from, anyway?

[END]

=== 3 | ecf2 | 81 ===
You're lookin' for a girl?[BRK]

Well, larpa is not a good
place for a nice girl to
be lost...[BRK]

Hope ya find her...[BRK]

.......in one piece.[END]

=== 4 | ed82 | 69 ===
Ya know, even though this
joint is crawlin' with
seedy types...[BRK]

...it kinda grows on ya
after a while...
[END]

=== 5 | edfe | 8f ===
We of althena's elite
guard are looking for a
strange girl...[BRK]

Say...you look suspicious!
Her name's lucia. She's not
a friend of yours, is she?[END]

=== 6 | eea0 | 7b ===
Stand back now! You're not
going anywhere, punks.[BRK]

We're under direct orders
from lord leo not to let
anyone suspicious out![END]

=== 7 | ef32 | 72 ===
There is a destroyer
disguised as a little girl
somewhere near here.[BRK]

If you see anything
suspicious, just call us.[END]

=== 8 | efbc | 9f ===
Hmmmm...a strange girl.
Say, miss...[BRK]

[POR02]
We, uh, we were just
leavin'. Nice talkin'
to ya...[BRK]

[POR00]
Well, geez! Sure, go ahead!
...just blow me off. Lousy
brats...
[END]

=== 9 | f074 | 5f ===
Ronfar? You're looking for
that miserable dog ronfar?[BRK]

That low-life cheated me
out of my house![END]

=== a | f0d6 | 6a ===
I had the best view in all
western larpa![BRK]

But that shameless pig 
tricked me into wagering
my whole house![END]

=== b | f158 | 9c ===
That dirtbag ronfar always
talks about how he used to
be a priest.[BRK]

Priest, my butt! If he was a
priest, he'd have some com-
passion and return my house!



[END]

=== c | f208 | 9f ===
Althena's guards try to keep
us from gambling because
it's bad for our souls...[BRK]

...or so they say.
Actually, we don't believe
them.[BRK]

...we just play in secret!
[END]

=== d | f2c4 | 79 ===
Are you looking for the
weird girl with the cool
red gown?[BRK]

I think she was the one I
saw caressing the grass and
flowers.[END]

=== e | f340 | 4d ===
The girl was staring at the
flowers like she'd never
seen one! What a kook...[END]

=== f | f3a4 | 3e ===
I'll never give up hope!
I will win my house back.
You'll see![END]

=== 10 | f3f0 | 112 ===
I think maybe i'll start
a chapter of unrealistic
gamblers anonymous.[BRK]

Let's make this our first
meeting. I'll start.[BRK]

Okay...my name is muerte,
and i'm a gamblaholic. Pity
me, and return my losses.[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, no! You're not draggin'
us into this mess! C'ya, ya
big retarded lug.
[END]

=== 11 | f510 | aa ===
[POR05]
Wah haa haa! Sorry, old guy!
I ain't fallin' for that
trick![BRK]

It's the oldest trick in
my book. Nope, i ain't 
bitin', chumpy.[BRK]

The house is still mine,
fair and square![END]

=== 12 | f5d2 | 82 ===
I will get that house back!
In fact, i'm training to
be the world's best cheat![BRK]

It's the only way you can
win against that dynamo![END]

=== 13 | f662 | c0 ===
Just you wait, ronfar! I've
learned enough tricks to win
back my house![BRK]

[POR02]
Shee! Give it up, already!
Ronfar is a much better
cheat than you'll ever be![BRK]

[POR00]
You won't be gettin' the
house back![END]

=== 14 | f73a | 31 ===
Oh, look! It's the famous
house-stealer of larpa![END]

=== 15 | f778 | 76 ===
[POR05]
I didn't steal anything,
chumpo. I won your house
fair and square![BRK]

Get over it and move on with
your pathetic life![END]

=== 16 | f806 | a5 ===
Aaachoo! When ronfar gets
back to his house,[BRK]

he's gotta find a way to
stop my cold![BRK]

This sneezing and itching
in my eyes is driving me
insane![BRK]

Aaa, aaa, aaaaachoooo![END]

=== 17 | f8c2 | 46 ===
Oh...oh...nooooo....
aaa...aah...ronfar...
...aachoooooooooooooo!




[END]

=== 18 | f91c | 87 ===
Hooo doggie! I'm plumb beat!
I...wish...i...could...sit![BRK]

Some stinking bozo stuck
liniment in my underpants![BRK]

I'm on fire! Ouh eee ahh!
[END]

=== 19 | f9ba | 97 ===
If i catch the prankster
that stuck this goop in my
shorts, i'll kill him![BRK]

I have a...sneaking...idea
it was ronfar! Ahhhh! I'll
wring...his...neckkkk![END]

=== 1a | fa60 | 123 ===
Noooo, i'm not ronfar. Too
bad, too. That guy's got
all the luck![BRK]

You're not from the tax
board, are you?[BRK]

[POR02]
Duh! Do we look like we're
from the tax board, 
einstein?[BRK]

[POR00]
Well, okay, then. If you're
lookin for ronfar, he's
probably at the bar.[BRK]

You know...gambling. Try
looking for him there.
[END]

=== 1b | fb9a | cf ===
I thought you were looking
for ronfar? I told you he
was at the bar...[BRK]

...what are you doin' back
here again?[BRK]

[POR02]
Hey, dipwad! We had to check
out your story, ok? We're
not amateurs, ya know![BRK]

Let's go, hiro!
[END]

=== 1c | fc7c | 6e ===
Lord leo was the last person
we'll see today. If you need
to do sanctuary business,[BRK]

please come back tomorrow.[END]

=== 1d | fcfe | 17d ===
[POR05]
Well, this is it! Home,
sweet home![BRK]

The girl's inside. Come on
in...[BRK]

Well now! What do we have
here...[BRK]

[POR00]
Ronfar:
i came to talk to you,
but nobody was home.[BRK]

I'll come back after
i finish work... 
                  lm[BRK]

[POR05]
Hmmm. This is certainly a
blast from the past. Wonder
when he's coming back?[BRK]

Oh well, i ain't losin' any
sleep over it. Come on in.
I'll show you the girl...[END]

=== 1e | fe8e | d ===

.....[END]

=== 1f | fea8 | 39 ===
[POR02]
Hmm, i wonder who 'lm' is?
We'd better stick around...[END]

=== 20 | fef8 | 7c ===
[POR02]
Lucia! We finally found you!
You should have never left
us![BRK]

Hiro and i were worried
sick![BRK]

...but you do look much
better.[END]

=== 21 | ff8c | 148 ===
[POR02]
Is that a good-bye? It
sounded just like a
good-bye...[BRK]

Where do you think you're
going, missy?[BRK]

[POR08]
Pentagulia. The holy city.[BRK]

I've learned that i can get
to althena's city by means
of dalton.[BRK]

So that is where my task
will lead me...[BRK]

[POR02]
Phoo! Dalton![BRK]

[POR08]
Good-bye, hiro and ruby.
Thank gwyn and ronfar for
me.[BRK]

[POR02]
B...but lucia!
[END]

=== 22 | 100de | 89 ===
[POR02]
Sh-she's gone, hiro.[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR02]
C'mon. At least we know
she's okay. Let's go back
to grandpa's house.[BRK]

He must be worried by now.[END]

=== 23 | 1017e | 10 ===
[POR05]
Hey...hiro!

[END]

=== 24 | 10198 | 1fb ===
[POR05]
Hey there! Just you and your
funny cat? Where's the
honey pot?[BRK]

The villagers are all talkin
'bout her, so she must be
around here somewhere.[BRK]

[POR02]
She went to dalton.[BRK]

[POR05]
Dalton?![BRK]

Now, why'd she go and do a
dumb thing like that? The
destiny's anchored there![BRK]

Leo's gotta be waiting for
her to walk into his trap![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh no! Hiro, what are we
gonna do now? Lucia's in
danger for sure![BRK]

[POR05]
I guess i'm part of this
little mess now.[BRK]

Tell you what. I'll go with
you to dalton to see if I
can't straighten this out.[END]

=== 25 | 103ac | e0 ===
Hey...hey...i don't know
about that...stop talking
to me! Get outta my head![BRK]

I don't wanna gamble against
ronfar again...shut up! Get
outta there, i said![BRK]

He used to be a priest! He
knows unholy tricks!...get
off me...ahhh!
[END]

=== 26 | 104a0 | e7 ===
R...ronfar! It's you! H-how
did you know to come?...shut
up! I can handle this...[BRK]

[POR05]
Say there, fella, have we
met? Can't say that I
remember ya.[BRK]

But i think a little
lithium might be just the
ticket for ya.[BRK]

...check it out, bud.

[END]

=== 27 | 1059e | ce ===
Yeah, there was a girl with
a red gown that came through
here....stop it! Right now![BRK]

...she was asking all sorts
of...get off him, idiot!...
strange questions.[BRK]

I say the chick's kinda
nuts, if you ask me...[END]

=== 28 | 10688 | 45 ===
Lucia was the girl's name.
...yes, bat breath! I know
who they are...[END]

=== 29 | 106e0 | 53 ===
That nutty girl named...hey!
Who's in charge here?!!...
lucia went toward the pier.[END]

=== 2a | 1074a | 119 ===
Hey, mister. Ya got a little
change? I gotta buy some uh
that lithium...[BRK]

These voices are....i saaaid
shuuutt up!...driving me
completely insane![BRK]

Ya got any spare change?[BRK]

[POR05]
Nope. Can't say that i do.
Try the free clinic, bud.[BRK]

The goddess helps those that
help themselves, ya know.[END]

=== 2b | 1087a | aa ===
Hey there! What happened to
that ronfar guy?[BRK]

Did he go back to gambling
the...aah, i know, that,
idiot!...day away?[BRK]

I knew he would. That fellow
is sick. He needs help...[END]

=== 2c | 10934 | ee ===
The other day i was walking
by the lake and i heard this
weird noise...[BRK]

It was...[BRK]

Shut up! I know what i'm
doing!...[BRK]

....it was sorta like
garba garba goom goom...[BRK]

...came from the direction
of the dragon ruins. Kinda
scary, if ya ask me.[END]

=== 2d | 10a36 | af ===
Hey there. Can ya lend a
guy down on his luck 
100 silver?[BRK]

I got a foolproof tip on a
horse in the seventh! It's
gonna make me rich![BRK]

I just need some money to
place the bet...[END]

=== 2e | 10afc | a0 ===
Tell ya what...give me the
100s and i'll pay you 1000s
when my horse comes in![BRK]

[POR02]
C'mon, get real! We're not
throwing our money away by
giving it to some drunk![END]

=== 2f | 10bb0 | 6c ===
Those stupid priests of the
sanctuary...what are they
thinking?[BRK]

The only destroyers here
are the bookmakers.[END]

=== 30 | 10c30 | cd ===
Some strange girl just came
by here. When i asked her
for money, she just stared.[BRK]

So i said 'you know, cash,
silver, bread, dough, gravy, 
wampum...?'[BRK]

And all she did was stare.
It gave me the creeps, man![END]

=== 31 | 10d10 | 80 ===
Hey...hey you! Come here.
I've got a business
proposition for ya...[BRK]

If ya lend me 100s, i'll
pay ya back 1000s with my
winnings![END]

=== 32 | 10d9e | 5f ===
[POR05]
What the heck are you
talking about?[BRK]

No gamble is a sure thing![BRK]

...well, unless i'm playing.[END]

=== 33 | 10e0c | 6b ===
Damn! I lost the money I
bet against you beating
the boss![BRK]

How are you going to make
it up to me? Hmm? Hmm?[END]

=== 34 | 10e84 | 4c ===
[POR09]
You pathetic fool! Start
taking some responsibility
for your own actions![END]

=== 35 | 10ee0 | 75 ===
Hello, adventurers! Welcome
to larpa! Have you been to
our fair city before?
[0x5]Yes, you chiseler!
No, can you help us?[END]

=== 36 | 10f64 | 81 ===
Ah, ha ha ha! Well then,
you're on to my little
tricks...[BRK]

Keep it under your hat,
okay? I think i see some
new folk over there...[END]

=== 37 | 10ff6 | 16a ===
Oh, i'd be happy to show
you the ropes.[BRK]

The people of larpa are all
fair and honest. They have
come here from all over.[BRK]

We have a long tradition of
clean and wholesome life.[BRK]

Visitors are required to pay
a 1000s gift to the city.[BRK]

The funds collected are used
to care for the sick and
aged.[BRK]

I am the designated visitor
fee collector. I'll happily
accept your gift.[END]

=== 38 | 11174 | 7b ===
Once you've been to larpa,
you'll never gamble any-
place else.[BRK]

Say, if you need any cash,
i'll buy the flying cat
for 10s![END]

=== 39 | 11206 | cf ===
Say, do you know that
freaky chick in the red
robe?[BRK]

She's wandering around here
talking about the blue star
and some crisis...[BRK]

The babe's completely out
of touch with reality. Says
some 'hiro' guy knows her.[END]

=== 3a | 112f0 | 52 ===
The blue star in crisis?
I keep hearing about it, [BRK]

but i don't know what it
means.[END]

=== 3b | 11356 | 8f ===
They say that althena came
from the blue star, but I
don't believe it.[BRK]

[POR02]
You know, we're starting to
think there's some truth
to that rumor...[END]

=== 3c | 113f4 | 7d ===
If ya got any problems
that need fixin', come
to me.[BRK]

My work is good, and my
fees are just right! Only
5000s a day! Ha ha ha![END]

=== 3d | 1147e | 6f ===
Sorry, folks, i'm off-duty.
I got a few gamblin' dates
to keep.[BRK]

[POR02]
Don't you ever get sick of
gambling? Sheesh![END]

=== 3e | 11504 | 94 ===
Hooommhh, where are all the
good men these days?[BRK]

The only thing the boys
around here want to do is
gamble.[BRK]

Well, i'm tellin' you, I
have needs, too![END]

=== 3f | 115b0 | 49 ===
This town is nothing but
a big never-never land for
lost boys...pathetic![END]

=== 40 | 11610 | bf ===
Say there, ronfar, why
don't you quit the gambling
and settle down?[BRK]

I could make it very worth
your while, pumpkin...[BRK]

[POR05]
What?! Geez, uh, sorry.
I don't need to settle
down, little desperado.[END]

=== 41 | 116ea | b5 ===
C'mon, ronfar! I wanna
have your baby.[BRK]

Let's settle down and play
house...[BRK]

[POR05]
Sorry, sugar bumps, i gotta
be free. Can't tie my boat
to only one dock, ya know.[BRK]

Nothing personal.



[END]

=== 42 | 117b2 | 99 ===
You just missed the show![BRK]

Some girl came by here
singing to herself and
staring into the sky.[BRK]

She seemed so innocent...
and yet no one knew who
she was.
[END]

=== 43 | 1185e | 41 ===
Larpa is free, and the
air is sweet today. It's
good to be alive![END]

=== 44 | 118ac | b8 ===
Say, ronfar...i heard you
gave up being a gambler.
What happened?[BRK]

[POR05]
Heard wrong, sugar plum.
I'm an unholy roller, with
luck that won't quit![BRK]

I ain't quittin' 'til i'm
six feet under![END]

=== 45 | 11978 | 5b ===
Say, ronfar, have ya decided
to settle down and play
house?[BRK]

I'm waiting for the day,
hunky![END]

=== 46 | 119e6 | 82 ===
Well, it looks like your
latest gamble turned out
okay...you won your life![BRK]

[POR05]
Don't talk like that...
you're making my back
itch![END]

=== 47 | 11a7c | b0 ===
That sanctuary is to the
goddess althena.[BRK]

Some say that the end of 
the world is at hand. I
think they're right...[BRK]

I don't know if even the
goddess althena herself
can save us![END]

=== 48 | 11b44 | 37 ===
You know, i'm not sure
the goddess althena even
exists.[END]

=== 49 | 11b8e | 8e ===
The sanctuary priests tell
us that althena can save
us from the world's end.[BRK]

I don't really think the
goddess even watches over
us any more...[END]

=== 4a | 11c34 | 79 ===
The girl with the red
robe?[BRK]

Was that the one that looked
so very sad?[BRK]

It seemed like she had just
lost her best friend...[END]

=== 4b | 11cc8 | 65 ===
If you hurry, maybe you can
catch up to her and cheer
her up.[BRK]

[POR02]
I just hope we can find
her again...[END]

=== 4c | 11d40 | 84 ===
The people of larpa don't
really like to have their
actions dictated.[BRK]

The priests of althena with
their rules make many of
them mad.[END]

=== 4d | 11dde | a1 ===
It's tough to get the
people here to follow
althena...[BRK]

They don't want to give
up their gambling...[BRK]

And besides, the priests
of althena are all crooked
anyway...[END]

=== 4e | 11e82 | 72 ===
It's not like the people
here don't like althena.[BRK]

They just don't believe in
anything except the power
of chance.
[END]

=== 4f | 11f08 | 84 ===
Say there, sweetie. You
look like you're looking
for someone. Need any help?
[0x5]Yes, i'm looking for ronfar.
No, i know my way around.[END]

=== 50 | 11f9c | a0 ===
Well, you won't find him in
the sanctuary, that's for
sure![BRK]

He traded the cloth for the
dice.[BRK]

Check out the alleys and
bars. The bum's probably in
another game.[END]

=== 51 | 1204c | 14 ===
Well, suit yourself.[END]

=== 52 | 12064 | 12 ===
Good luck, then...[END]

=== 53 | 1208e | 5b ===
Man, if playing sick is all
it takes to get ronfar's
attention...[BRK]

...then call me terminal![END]

=== 54 | 12100 | 83 ===
Ronfar! You've given up
gambling! That's great![BRK]

[POR05]
Whoa there! I haven't given
up anything. I just have
some business to attend to.[END]

=== 55 | 12196 | 3e ===
The air is clear and the
sun is bright.[BRK]

It's good to be alive![END]

=== 56 | 121e8 | d8 ===
Starting another journey,
ronfar, my dear?[BRK]

[POR05]
Yep! Now you behave while
i'm gone. I want you nice
and rested when i get back.[BRK]

[POR02]
What? So you can be your
normal chauvinistic pig and
give her a workout?[BRK]

Oh, please...
[END]

=== 57 | 122d4 | e4 ===
You know, just between you
and me, the best looking
man here is ronfar![BRK]

He's just good enough to
eat![BRK]

And control! When the dice
are in his hands, it's
almost like magic![BRK]

[POR02]
Yeah, right...magic. I'm
so impressed, i'm yawning...
[END]

=== 58 | 123d0 | ac ===
Ohhh, ronfar, you're
just the dreamiest...[BRK]

Drop those dice and work
your magic on me, baby.[BRK]

[POR05]
Well, honey bomb, winky says
yes, but thinky says I
gotta get to work. Sorry.[END]

=== 59 | 12498 | 8f ===
Oh ronfar, my knees are
weak...[BRK]

You little devil. You're
working your magic on
my heart...[BRK]

[POR05]
Hey...don't blame me if
you're easy, sweetcheeks.[END]

=== 5a | 1253e | 6e ===
It's so maddening! I see
ronfar every day,[BRK]

but i can't get him to 
commit to anything more
than a cheap fling![END]

=== 5b | 125c4 | bb ===
Oh, ronfar, my heart is
yours![BRK]

[POR05]
Are you still on that kick?
I told you! I have a girl-
friend now![BRK]

...get it?[BRK]

[POR00]
Well then, let me be your
dice. Lay your hands on
these lucky bones...

[END]

=== 5c | 1268c | 44 ===
[POR09]
Ronfar! Father said you'd
never change, and i guess
he was right![END]

=== 5d | 126ec | 47 ===
Ronfar...sweetie...please
reconsider. I could be your
biggest win yet.
[END]

=== 5e | 1275a | 196 ===
What in tarnation is that
freaky red thing flapping
over your shoulder, boy?[BRK]

[POR02]
Hey! Who you calling freaky,
goober?![BRK]

I'm a red dragon, and you 
better show me some respect,
or i'll toast your hide![BRK]

[POR00]
Wah haa hah! I didn't know
red dragons were now coming
in bite-sized packages![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, really? Well have you
ever seen a 'bite-sized'
package do this?[BRK]

[POR00]
Ooooouuuuch![BRK]

Hey! You burned me, you
little runt!!![END]

=== 5f | 1291c | b7 ===
[POR02]
Now then, what do you have
to say for yourself, pig?[BRK]

[POR00]
Well, you can blow fire,
all right, ya lousy furry
lizard...[BRK]

[POR02]
What did you say?[BRK]

[POR00]
Oh...uh...nothing...[BRK]

Nice day, huh?



[END]

=== 60 | 129fe | 4d ===
Okay, okay, i got the point.
The little one there can 
blow fire...big whoop.[END]

=== 61 | 12a5e | 120 ===
A while ago, i was takin'
a leak in that alley, and
this girl came up to watch![BRK]

Can you believe that? She
just sat there staring!
I was totally embarrassed![BRK]

[POR02]
That's what you get for
leaking the lizard outside
in a city, idiot![BRK]

Didn't anyone ever show
you how to use a toilet?
...sheesh![END]

Okay. Now then, everything

Goddess althena, hear my

Loose the bonds that now

Shatter the darkness with

Ronfar! What's wrong? 
Lucia's in agony![BRK]

This is impossible! The

I-i've never failed to

Ohhhh...yes! It...it worked![BRK]

It's not complete, but the
main spell is broken. She'll
just have to...

Oh! I didn't know anyone

Yes, well, the sanctuary is
closed for the day. Come

No thanks, old man. I don't
have any need to come back
to this place.[BRK]

Lucia, you can rest at my 
house with your friends. 
Let's go...[END]

Are you still trying to
break the curse on the
poor girl?[END]

The goddess is good to those

[POR02]
Especially if they donate in
cash, right?[END]

=== 70 | 1511a | 5e ===
Please donate your spare
money to the sanctuary. [BRK]

Althena will reward your
generosity someday.[END]

The sanctuary is still
closed for the day.[BRK]

Please come back later.[BRK]

[POR05]
C'mon, hiro. Let's go to
my house and let lucia 
rest.[BRK]

She's had a really tough
time, and i'm sure she needs
it.[END]

Thanks be to althena, the

goodness springs forth...[BRK]

But goodness has a price to
be paid...donate now, won't
you?
[END]

I now know that the goddess
cannot fix all of mankind's
mistakes.[BRK]

We must take responsibility
for our own actions...[END]

The most important thing we
all must possess is a
willing spirit.[BRK]

The goddess will not help
those that are not willing
to help themselves.[END]

=== 75 | 15438 | c4 ===
You're looking for the girl
with red clothes?[BRK]

If you pray to althena, and
your heart is true, she will
show you the way, i'm sure.[BRK]

The best way to show that
your heart is true is to
donate freely.[END]

=== 76 | 15510 | 9d ===
The people of this town
are deserving only of
althena's wrath![BRK]

All they want to do is
gamble their lives away![BRK]

And they never donate any
of their winnings...[END]

We've worked so hard to

But it's come so close to

As long as the goddess is

Ah, yes. I sense that the
girl in the red robe is
fading from us.[BRK]

Quick--donate to althena
and pray for her mercy.[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, i really don't think
that's gonna work...[BRK]

Say, do you happen to
know a priest named ronfar?[BRK]

[POR00]
Priest?!? Ronfar is no
priest!![BRK]

He has traded his calling
for implements of sin.[END]

=== 7a | 157e2 | 4b ===
That miserable failure,
ronfar, could have been the
greatest priest of all.[END]

Our world now careens toward
destruction...[BRK]

Only the goddess althena has
the power to save us.[END]

=== 7c | 158c2 | 42 ===
I can't believe that our
world was saved from the
brink by humans.[END]

[POR05]
Now you can get to more
important jobs...like
learning to shoot craps![END]

These miserable souls do
not understand the danger
our world is in.[BRK]

If they did, they'd be
crying like babies...[END]

Lucia? No, i can't say that
i know of her.[BRK]

Say, can i interest you in
becoming a member of the
sanctuary boosters club?[END]

=== 80 | 15a88 | bc ===
Say, can i cut you a deal
on a slightly used althena
statue?[BRK]

They make great hall trees!
Attractive and functional.[BRK]

With the world going to hell
in a handbasket, we don't
need 'em anymore.[END]

yourself up about it.[BRK]

Trot on over to the bar and

Hrmph! Well, it's not true,
but i kinda like the sound

Kinda enhances my special

=== 87 | 15df0 | d7 ===
Huh? A girl wearing a red
dress? No, i haven't seen
her.[BRK]

But rather than chasing
skirts, why not repent from
your sins and serve althena?[BRK]

[POR05]
Done it, seen it, been it.
Sorry, no dice...[BRK]

Uh, pardon the pun...hahaha!
[END]

If zophar had succeeded,
our world would have been
lost forever![BRK]

Thank heavens for the

If you offer your silver
to the goddess althena, 
you will grow strong.[END]

=== 8a | 15fc0 | a4 ===
Some of the village folk
give to the sanctuary,[BRK]

but most are heathen pigs
who will wither in the hot
fires of althena's fury.[BRK]

At least, i'm pretty sure
they will...[END]

=== 8b | 16074 | 6f ===
You can ask althena to do
anything on your behalf.[BRK]

But it's really just good
manners to donate something,
too.
[END]

=== 8c | 160fc | 7e ===
We are the guardians of
althena's truth.[BRK]

Through us, the world will
come to know althena's
goodness.[BRK]

...if they donate enough.[END]

But in all this time, we
have not made even one
person here convert![BRK]

This town is crawlin' with
sinners!

Lucia...lucia...hmm...[BRK]

I have heard that name once
before. I think lord leo was
trying to find her.[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh no! I don't like the
sound of that one bit! We've
got to find her!
[END]

=== 8f | 162be | 88 ===
I was thinking of starting
a bingo tournament to pack
this place.[BRK]

Do you think it'll work?
Of course, all proceeds will
go to althena...[END]

Hey, that sounds like just
the ticket to get the 
sinners in here![BRK]

Come right down to their

To break the spell, we'll

There's no priest named
ronfar in the local althena
cult...[END]

=== 137 | 20294 | 51 ===
Well, you don't have to be
rude about it![BRK]

Just remember, i'm here if
you need me.[END]

=== 138 | 202fc | 7f ===
Information! Information!
All for the price of a small
meal...so how 'bout it?
[0x5]Tell me about ronfar.
Uh, no, i don't think so.[END]

=== 139 | 2038a | 50 ===
Tonmar...tonmar...yes!
There was a man named tonmar
that died about 5 years ago.[END]

=== 13a | 20408 | 99 ===
Ask me anything. I'll surely
try to help you...if you can
pay the price.[BRK]

But don't ask me about this
'ronfar' fellow, because I
honestly don't know him.
[END]

=== 13b | 204b8 | 97 ===
Hey, ronfar, i'm keeping my
end of our little bargain.[BRK]

I'll keep giving vague
answers to everyone that
asks about you...[BRK]

At least until my debt's
paid.[END]

=== 13c | 2056a | fe ===
Say there, ronfar. Are you
cheating again? You know,
that's a capital offense...[BRK]

[POR05]
Chief! I'm shocked that you
would even say that to me![BRK]

You yourself know what a
fine, upstanding citizen I
am in this community...[BRK]

Why would you say such a
hurtful thing?[END]

=== 13d | 2067c | 148 ===
Say, aren't you guys friends
of that lucia girl?[BRK]

Don't try to deny it, i saw
you with her! Anyway, she
wanted some information,[BRK]

so i told her how to get to
pentagulia by way of a ship
in dalton.[BRK]

Then the crazy girl split
without paying my
information fee![BRK]

But now that you're here,
i'll get it from you! It
was 30s. So pay up!

[END]

=== 13e | 207da | 3a ===
Well, i guess if you
haven't got 30s, this'll
have to do.
[END]

=== 13f | 20846 | 1e ===
Thanks. Now get outta 
here...[END]

=== 140 | 20868 | 5f ===
What? Where did that girl
go?[BRK]

She said she wanted to see
a sandship and headed to
the harbor...[END]

=== 141 | 208de | d3 ===
Is that lucia some spoiled
little rich girl?[BRK]

When i asked her for payment
she just stared at me like
i was from another planet.[BRK]

It kinda gave me the creeps.
Anyway, she went toward the
harbor. Have you seen her?[END]

=== 142 | 20a04 | 1a ===
Thanks for the tip, chief![END]

=== 143 | 20a38 | 84 ===
I quit selling information.
My wife was complaining too
much about my crazy hours.[BRK]

She wants me just to be the
mayor, and that's it.[END]

=== 144 | 20ac0 | 4c ===
Maybe my wife is right. I
think i'll concentrate on
just being a good mayor.[END]

=== 145 | 20b24 | ca ===
This gambler's town is no
place to raise a child![BRK]

Our daughter needs schooling
and friends, but this town
is nothing but scoundrels.[BRK]

I wish my husband would
clean this town up. After
all, he is mayor...[END]

=== 146 | 20c06 | 117 ===
Say, just keep away from
our daughter. [BRK]

You look like another bad
influence, and i'm telling
you, she doesn't need it![BRK]

She's got several out-of-
town suitors, and i don't
want her chances ruined.[BRK]

She's gonna marry and get
out of this town if it
kills me![BRK]

[POR02]
Uh...is she serious?
[END]

=== 147 | 20d30 | 9f ===
Oh, who am i kidding? Our
daughter is dumb as a post
and ugly as sin.[BRK]

What idiot would want to
marry her?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Uh, that's just between
you and me, okay?
[END]

=== 148 | 20de2 | 72 ===
All the girls in this town
these days are loose.[BRK]

Our daughter won't be like
them! She'll get a man with
her charm.[END]

=== 149 | 20e62 | 52 ===
[POR07]
Whew! With looks like that,
she better be the most
charming girl on the planet![END]

=== 14a | 20ec8 | 105 ===
No, no, no! Get out of
here this minute![BRK]

You're that weird girl who
came here and broke every
dish in the house![BRK]

[POR08]
I'm...i'm very sorry. When
i first came here i was...
well...clumsy.[BRK]

[POR02]
Give the girl a break! She
didn't do any permanent
damage, butt-breath!

[END]

=== 14b | 20ff4 | 105 ===
Ooohh! Aren't you the brave,
strong lad that defeated
zophar?[BRK]

Our daughter would make an
excellent wife for you.
Come...i'll introduce you.[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, hiro...take my word on
this...you do not want to
meet this...this...[BRK]

(And i'm using the term
very loosely)...girl.[END]

=== 14c | 21110 | f0 ===
Hiro, you're a nice lad.
You must know the value
of inner beauty.[BRK]

Our daughter has all her
beauty on the inside,
hidden for you to discover.[BRK]

Say, if you'll marry her,
i'll pay for the wedding
and set you up in a house![BRK]

Pretty please...???

Those kooks from the cult
of althena came to town and
set up shop recently.[BRK]

All they do is beg for money
to make bigger shrines![BRK]

Geez! I didn't think that
was what althena was about![END]

=== 154 | 21672 | 6d ===
No, i don't want to talk
about those weirdoes from
the cult of althena.[BRK]

All it does is get me in a
bad mood. [END]

=== 155 | 216f2 | 9e ===
I taught the new girl how
to gamble, and now she's
a money machine![BRK]

The girl can't lose![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh no! He's gotta be talking
about lucia! We've got to
find her...[END]

=== 156 | 217a4 | da ===
The culties have been making
a big fuss lately, saying
our world's end is near.[BRK]

It's really starting to get
on my nerves.[BRK]

I can't stop thinking about
twisting their pointy little
heads off...[BRK]

That's just not like me...[END]

=== 157 | 21892 | 87 ===
I think the followers of
althena have really changed.[BRK]

I'm giving them the benefit
of the doubt, now that they
seem to be trying harder.[END]

=== 158 | 21930 | 4e ===
Since the fake althena was
exposed, the culties have
turned into real priests![END]

=== 159 | 21996 | 9d ===
My boss is a pretty greedy
guy. He wants money for
everything he does.[BRK]

He's got this town tied up
on his little pinky.[BRK]

But don't tell him i said
that, okay?
[END]

=== 15a | 21a4e | 102 ===
I never argue with the boss.
He's kinda temperamental
sometimes.[BRK]

...oops, i called him 'boss.'
He don't like that too much.[BRK]

It's a habit from the old
days...before he bought the
election...[BRK]

Whoop! Look what i gone and
done...don't repeat what I
jus' told ya![END]

=== 15b | 21b6c | 49 ===
