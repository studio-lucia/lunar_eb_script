Ah! You've returned! I...I
don't know how to thank
you!![BRK]

All of the carnival members
have returned safely.[BRK]

And the best part is that
the thicket disappeared!
The exit is now clear![BRK]

[POR10]
That is good news, indeed![BRK]

We were successful in part
because I was able to modify
my dance steps for combat...[BRK]

...But...Giban, the time
has come for me to...[BRK]

[POR00]
...!? Jean, what's the
matter?[BRK]

You seem troubled, dear...[BRK]

[POR10]
I've decided that I'm going
to leave the carnival for
a while.[BRK]

I've got to face some
problems I've been running
away from...[BRK]

I wish I could tell you 
more...Just know that it's
something I must do.[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, I know your demons
haunt you.[BRK]

If the time to face them
has come, so be it![BRK]

You'll never be at peace 
until you put an end to 
what's troubling you.[BRK]

Perhaps Karate Master Lunn
in Meribia will help you
through this.[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR00]
Jean, we've all done things
in the past that we wish we
could change.[BRK]

You've been given a chance
at redemption. I pray that
you do not waste it.[BRK]

[POR10]
I don't know what to say...[BRK]

[POR00]
Just tell me that you'll
return in one piece. [BRK]

Now get out of here...

[END]

=== 1 | 82a8 | 46 ===
[POR02]
Listen, Hiro! It sounds
like music...[BRK]

What's going on over
there?

[END]

=== 2 | 82f8 | 79 ===
[POR10]
Say, how did you find us?
We don't like to be
followed...[BRK]

[POR02]
Relax, we're just passing
through. Let's get going,
Hiro.[END]

=== 3 | 8388 | 206 ===
[POR10]
Hiro...Hmm, that's the
strangest name I've ever
heard...[BRK]

And this is the most rag-
tag party I've ever seen...[BRK]

A weird flying creature,
a lady in a strange red
dress, and a card shark.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm not strange! Why don't
you take a look at yourself?[BRK]

[POR05]
I'll show you what I really
want to be remembered for.[BRK]

It'll just take five 
minutes...[BRK]

[POR08]
...What's wrong with my
.......dress!?[BRK]

[POR10]
Hey, relax! I wasn't making
fun of you![BRK]

I was just making an
observation....[BRK]

Anyway, you're free to 
stay with us as long as
you like.
[END]

=== 4 | 85a6 | 121 ===
[POR10]
Hiro, where are you and
your companions headed?[BRK]

What?...The holy city of
Pentagulia! Are you going
to go see the Goddess?[BRK]

I thought that the Goddess
was just a legend...[BRK]

I wonder if she really does
exist?[BRK]

[POR08]
Why do so many people doubt
the existence of Althena?[BRK]

It is so very strange...[END]

=== 5 | 86e2 | 82 ===
[POR10]
Don't be shy. You are free
to go anywhere in our little
caravan.[BRK]

We have no secrets from the
outside world. See for
yourself...[END]

=== 6 | 8780 | 1a9 ===
[POR10]
We were passing through this
forest, but were stopped by
the thicket over there.[BRK]

I don't think there's a way
around it.[BRK]

To make matters worse, we
have heard a terrible noise
coming from the woods.[BRK]

It sounds like a terrible
monster...perhaps the one
that made the thicket.[BRK]

Some of the performers are
getting really scared...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh great! This is the part
where she asks us to help
her...[BRK]

Just watch...I know it's
coming...
[END]

=== 7 | 893c | 29f ===
[POR10]
If only I knew exactly where
the sounds were coming from![BRK]

Maybe then I could find the
monster and get back the
kidnapped...[BRK]

[POR02]
What did I say!? Looks like
they need our help.[BRK]

Say, Jean, the voices are
coming from the hole in the
eastern tree over there...[BRK]

[POR10]
...What hole!? I...I don't
see any hole in the tree
over there....???[BRK]

[POR02]
That's because it has a
magic spell on it. Only
we can see it.[BRK]

[POR10]
Hmmm...The magic must've
been cast to keep outsiders
from finding it.[BRK]

Show me this hole...Perhaps
with your help, we can
defeat this, this...beast![BRK]

[POR02]
Of course! We should be able
to make short work of this
thing![BRK]

[POR10]
Let's go![BRK]

I will find a way to get
my friends back...[END]

=== 8 | 8be4 | 74 ===
[POR10]
Okay, Ruby, show me the
way.[BRK]

[POR02]
Come on, Hiro, we'd better
hurry and get that monster
before it gets anyone else![END]

=== 9 | 8c70 | 1fb ===
[POR00]
Howdy, strangers! My name is
Giban. I'm in charge of this
little caravan.[BRK]

We were on our way to the
carnival in the Madoria
Plains area.[BRK]

But we seem to be unable
to exit from this part
of the forest.[BRK]

We've just been stuck here
practicing for a carnival
we may never reach...[BRK]

[POR02]
Is that what Jean was doing?
Practicing? It was awfully
good...[BRK]

[POR00]
Oh, you saw Jean dancing?
She's the best dancer we
have.[BRK]

Whenever she creates a new
dance step, she puts on a
show for us.[BRK]

That's what she was doing
earlier...[END]

=== a | 8e82 | 108 ===
[POR00]
I met Jean when she was a
scared and lonely young
lady.[BRK]

I've raised her as my own
daughter since she was
found.[BRK]

I think dancing is the only
thing that keeps her from
her dark secrets.[BRK]

I've grown quite attached
to the girl...Don't know
what I'd do without her...[END]

=== b | 8f9e | 74 ===
[POR00]
You mark my words, Jean is
going to be the best dancer
in the whole world...[BRK]

...If we all live to see
that day...[END]

=== c | 9026 | d5 ===
[POR00]
You're going after the
monster that did this, hm?[BRK]

Jean, are you sure you're
making the right decision?[BRK]

I'd die if I lost you...[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, Giban. I have to go.
If I don't, soon we'll all
be captives of this thing.[END]

=== d | 910a | d3 ===
[POR00]
Well, it looks like we're
ready to get out of this
forest.[BRK]

...Jean, you know that you
can always come with us...[BRK]

I know, you have to take 
care of your past. Just
hurry back...[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[BRK]

Thank you, Giban.[END]

=== e | 91ec | 76 ===
Hey?! How did you get here?[BRK]

If I was you, I would go
back the way you came.[BRK]

I've got a bad feeling about
this place...[END]

=== f | 9276 | eb ===
You'd better hurry and get
out of here before the noise
starts again.[BRK]

I just know it's some sort
of terrible monster...[BRK]

[POR02]
I heard those voices, too.
Come on Hiro! Let's find
a way outta this place![BRK]

[POR00]
Hopefully...it's not too
late...
[END]

=== 10 | 936a | 133 ===
Ohhh nooo! There it is
again! I've gotta get
outta here![BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, the sound seemed to
be coming from the enchanted
path in this tree![BRK]

But these people can't see
it because they don't have
the woodsman's spell...[BRK]

[POR05]
If that creepy sound was
coming from there,[BRK]

that monster has got to
be somewhere nearby...[END]

=== 11 | 94a0 | 39 ===
[POR02]
Oh no, Hiro! Did you see
that? What're we gonna
do???![END]

=== 12 | 94ec | 91 ===
Jean, thank you for saving
my life. I'm forever in your
debt.[BRK]

[POR10]
No, you're not. You should
be thanking Hiro and the
others for saving your life.[END]

=== 13 | 958c | d0 ===
Don't you just love our
carefree way of life?[BRK]

We have no worries. We take
life one day at a time.[BRK]

This path blockage is our
only problem.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Okay! So it's a big problem!
As if you don't have
problems![END]

=== 14 | 9670 | 91 ===
Did...Did you see what just
happened? Oh my god![BRK]

The ground...It just opened
up and swallowed half the
troupe![BRK]

We'll never get out of here
alive![END]

=== 15 | 9710 | ad ===
Yes!!! I don't know how to
thank you.[BRK]

If we hurry, we'll be able
to get to the carnival
before it's over, Jean.[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm sorry, but I've got
to take care of something
first...[END]

=== 16 | 97d4 | 94 ===
'Join the carnival! Go see
the world! You'll have an
adventure!' They all said.[BRK]

Now I'm probably stuck in
these creepy woods forever![BRK]

Some life...

[END]

=== 17 | 9884 | 96 ===
I hate it here. This
carnival is no fun at
all.[BRK]

I knew I should've been an
undertaker...but nooooooo,[BRK]

'Try the carnival,' they all
said. Ha! Some fun![END]

=== 18 | 9936 | 7e ===
I tell ya, if Althena cared
at all about us, we wouldn't
be stuck here.[BRK]

[POR08]
Why do people blame Althena
for all their problems?[END]

=== 19 | 99c4 | 99 ===
Geez, it took you forever to
come and find me![BRK]

What were you waiting for?
The monster to eat me?[BRK]

[POR10]
You seem a bit ungrateful
for what we did, don't you?[END]

=== 1a | 9a6c | d0 ===
Are you tired of those 
phony fortune-tellers?[BRK]

Then step right up! I've got
the best set of cards in the
business.[BRK]

You'll love my friendly, 
quality service.[BRK]

I'm even endorsed by a 
former star of Miami Vice.[END]

=== 1b | 9b50 | f0 ===
I knew that you were going
to come and save me, Jean.
I read it in the cards...[BRK]

[POR10]
Yeah, just like you foretold
that the end of the world
was coming five years ago.[BRK]

And the time when you said
that I was going to meet
a handsome stranger...
[END]

=== 1c | 9c58 | 77 ===
I've just read in the cards
that Jean will be leaving
the carnival...[BRK]

And I also predict that
you will return to us...
[END]

=== 1d | 9ce2 | 60 ===
Ahhh...What a beautiful
day to be alive...[BRK]

The clean, fresh air...
I think I've found paradise!
[END]

=== 1e | 9d5a | 53 ===
I think I'm going to skip
practice today and just take
in the beauty of this place.[END]

=== 1f | 9dbc | 92 ===
I'm kinda depressed that you
rescued me.[BRK]

I just love the whole under-
ground cave thing. I wish I
was still there.[BRK]

[POR10]
Uh...I'm sorry...I think...?[END]

=== 20 | 9e5e | 86 ===
Of all the people I have 
taught how to dance, only 
Jean has mastered the art.[BRK]

She is, without a doubt, the
best dancer in the world.[END]

=== 21 | 9ef8 | 6e ===
Please! You have to find
a way to stop the terrible
monster![BRK]

Our friends...All of our
friends are just...gone![END]

=== 22 | 9f74 | 39 ===
[POR10]
Don't worry. We'll find some
way to get them all back![END]

=== 23 | 9fc0 | 109 ===
Jean! You're still alive!![BRK]

This is great! Now everyone
will know that I'm the best
teacher in the world.[BRK]

There is nobody that can
dance, sing, and fight as
well as you.[BRK]

And I taught you![BRK]

[POR10]
I'm grateful for all that
you have shown me. You
are an excellent teacher.
[END]

=== 24 | a0e0 | d9 ===
I'm going to make sure that
everyone knows that I 
trained you, Jean...[BRK]

They must know that I 
trained the best fighter 
and dancer in the world.[BRK]

[POR10]
I want to be known for my
dance, not my fighting.
Please honor that.[END]

=== 25 | a1c8 | fb ===
Just look at my totally buff
body. It drives the women
mad.[BRK]

They all want to come and 
weave their names in my 
chest hair.[BRK]

[POR05]
Pshaw! That's nothing,
sonny boy.[BRK]

I've had women tattoo my 
name all over their butts![BRK]

[POR02]
I'd tattoo Hiro's name on
my butt![END]

=== 26 | a2d6 | ec ===
You can't stay away from my
beauty, can you?[BRK]

Even as darkness falls
around us and our mortal
souls are in danger...[BRK]

...still you appreciate my
smashing good looks.[BRK]

I'm glad that I could bring
some joy to your life in
this dark moment...[END]

=== 27 | a3d0 | 11 ===
[POR10]
Oh please.....[END]

=== 28 | a3f0 | ea ===
Jean, thank you for saving
me.[BRK]

It would have been a
travesty if a body like this
were destroyed...[BRK]

Now all womankind will once
again be able to shudder at
the sight of perfection...[BRK]

[POR10]
I'm thinking I should've let
the monster eat you.[END]

=== 29 | a4ee | 198 ===
I saw you guys talking with
Jean. Please don't drag her
into any trouble![BRK]

I don't think I could live 
with myself if anything 
ever happened to her...[BRK]

I remember the first day I
saw Jean...[BRK]

She looked as if she was 
dead. Her clothes were torn
and bloody...[BRK]

It was several days before
she even had the strength
to open her eyes.[BRK]

Jean has never told me what
she ran away from, but I 
know it still haunts her.[END]

=== 2a | a69e | 6f ===
It was rumored that Jean
used to be a trained 
assassin...[BRK]

But I just can't imagine
dear Jean hurting a fly...
[END]

=== 2b | a720 | 48 ===
Now that the monster has
taken all our friends, what
are we going to do?[END]

=== 2c | a77c | 78 ===
What's happened to everyone?
Jean, you aren't going to go
fight, are you?[BRK]

[POR10]
...I'll be back. I have to
save my friends![END]

=== 2d | a804 | 95 ===
Jean, I've prayed for your
safe return...[BRK]

...and now you're thinking
about leaving again, I hear.[BRK]

[POR10]
I must. I can't run away
from my past forever...[END]

=== 2e | a8ac | 64 ===
Jean and I are going to 
dance together soon at the
world finals.[BRK]

I know we'll win. Jean's
the best![END]

=== 2f | a928 | b1 ===
I will admit that some-
times, I get a bit jealous
of Jean's talent.[BRK]

Usually it's when people are
gaga over her and ignoring
me.[BRK]

I hate myself for it, but
hey! I'm only human...[END]

=== 30 | a9f0 | 5d ===
Oh no, what's happening to
us?[BRK]

Goddess Althena! Please save
us from the evil that is
upon us![END]

=== 31 | aa60 | 8a ===
Jean, is it true that you're
going to join forces with
these outsiders?[BRK]

Does Giban know about this?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, so don't worry about
it, okay?[END]

=== 32 | ab02 | 9a ===
Hey, Jean, if you're leaving,
that means I'm the new head
dancer![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't get too comfortable in
your new position. I'll be 
back before you know it!



[END]

=== 33 | abb0 | 111 ===
Welcome to our little 
traveling carnival![BRK]

I hope that you'll be able
to stay a while and enjoy 
these pleasant surroundings.[BRK]

We're trying to find a way 
to get past that giant 
thicket up ahead.[BRK]

I hope they find a way
around this thing.[BRK]

Otherwise, I think we're
all stuck.[END]

=== 34 | acd8 | 6a ===
I'm responsible for training
all the wild animals in this
carnival.[BRK]

Wanna see where the lion 
bit me last?[END]

=== 35 | ad56 | 8a ===
Say, we're looking for some
new blood to join us here
in the carnival.[BRK]

[POR02]
Now that half your troupe
got sucked away, I bet you
are...




[END]

=== 36 | adf0 | 108 ===
Thank you for saving my 
life! I thought I was going
to die down there.[BRK]

Jean, I didn't know you
could fight like that.[BRK]

Say, I'm going to work out a
new act with you and some of
the wild animals, okay?[BRK]

[POR10]
I don't think so. I won't
fight for the amusement of
others![END]

=== 37 | af0c | ba ===
Ke...ke...eeee
Ku ke...ku...ke
Ka ka...ka...ka![BRK]

[POR08]
I don't think I've ever
seen anything like this
before. What is it?[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, hello, Lucia? It's a
bird. Just a dumb old bird.[BRK]

Sheesh...

[END]

=== 38 | afde | b8 ===
What the hell is going on
here?![BRK]

Wiiillllbbuuurrr![BRK]

[POR08]
Ruby, it can talk! It seems
like it's frightened of
something...[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh man! It looks like it's
going to freak out any 
minute now![END]

=== 39 | b0aa | bc ===
Don't just look at me like
that! Unhook me from these
damn wagons!![BRK]

Didn't you see what the
monster just did? We gotta
get outta here![BRK]

[POR02]
I think I liked you better
when you didn't talk...[END]

=== 3a | b17a | 112 ===
Whew! That was close! At
least you pulled it off at
the last minute![BRK]

I thought we were all
dead meat back there,
Wiiilllburrr![BRK]

[POR02]
Why do you keep calling me
that??!!![BRK]

[POR05]
I think it thinks it's a
horse, of course.[BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar, that's ridiculous!
Where'd you ever get that
idea?[END]

My big sister Jean is a fan
dancer now, but I heard she
used to be a karate master![BRK]

Okay, so she's not my real
sister, but we were raised
together.[BRK]

One day, I want to grow up
to be a strong karate
fighter![BRK]

I've asked Jean to teach me
karate, but she always gets
sad when I mention it.[BRK]

I wish I knew why she did
that...[END]

I want to learn to be a

I love making the noise...[BRK]

Hiiiiiiii---yaaaaaaa![END]

I'm scared! Please defeat
the bad monster before it
takes any more people![END]

[POR10]
I'll do what I can, little
brother. But I don't think
I need to use karate.[END]

=== 40 | d1e6 | 15d ===
Jean...You're going to leave
us, aren't you? Please don't
go![BRK]

I-I need you to stay so you
can teach me karate![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't worry, little brother.
I'll be back soon to teach
you what you need to know.[BRK]

But I won't teach you the
aggressive karate of death,
only the defensive moves.[BRK]

That's all you need to know
to become a strong defender
of our troupe.

[END]

=== 41 | d352 | 11e ===
That Jean! Always pretending
no one notices her![BRK]

Before she came, I was the
best dancer in our caravan![BRK]

Then, we had to go and
rescue that stupid girl![BRK]

When we found her she was
just a poor urchin in torn
karate rags![BRK]

Hah! I wish she had never
joined us. Then I would
still be the best![END]

Ah...ahhh...ahhhh! That...
That thing! It's going to
kill us all!

tough for me to admit...[BRK]

But you saved our caravan,
and I owe you my deepest
thanks.
[END]

=== 44 | d566 | ff ===
I've been jealous of your
talent. I want that to
change.[BRK]

Jean, I know we haven't been
the best of friends, but I'd
like to try.[BRK]

[POR10]
Oh! That's so good to hear
from you! I never wanted to
be rivals anyway.[BRK]

From now on, we're nothing
but the best of friends![END]

=== 45 | d678 | 1f8 ===
...Oh, Jean! Do you know the
affection I feel for you?[BRK]

Ever since I first saw your
flowing skirt rise in tempo
to the music...I knew.[BRK]

I don't care that your past
is shrouded in secrecy. I
can live with your sins.[BRK]

I want to be with you, to
hold you...to...to rub warm
goat's milk on your...[BRK]

[POR02]
Whew! Is it getting hot in
here? I think it's getting
hotter in here...[BRK]

You know, I think this Jean
gal needs to be warned about
this guy.[BRK]

[POR00]
Warned? Why? Why would you
have to warn Jean of the
depth of my love?[END]

=== 46 | d888 | 8c ===
Jean, Jean, jelly bean. Let
me wrap my tongue around
your gourmet sweets...[BRK]

[POR02]
Have you said this stuff to
Jean's face?[BRK]

I bet she'd slap it![END]

=== 47 | d928 | 15f ===
What? A monster is attacking
our caravan?! Oh, why'd it
have to be today!!??[BRK]

If I didn't have diarrhea, 
I'd be able to show Jean
my brave skill![BRK]

[POR02]
Um, yeah...right. Diarrhea.
You should try anyway.[BRK]

Maybe you could immobilize
the monster like one of
those sticky-foam guns.[BRK]

It could be your secret
weapon.[BRK]

Hehe...or better yet...your
stinky weapon...[END]

=== 48 | da9a | bd ===
Oh Jean! I knew you would
be able to defeat that
terrible, terrible monster.[BRK]

Jean...sweetheart, come to
me so I can hold you close.[BRK]

Excuse me? Do I know you?[BRK]

There must be some mistake.

I've heard you're leaving

Just know that anytime you

I just love to sing. It does
something to my spirit, my
soul...[BRK]

But the head of the Althena
Cult doesn't allow any song
in his shrine![BRK]

I thought that was strange,
since the Althena of legend
was known for her singing...[BRK]

But what is the purpose of
song? I don't understand...

In return for you helping
our little caravan, I'll
make a song for you.[BRK]

It starts out like this...[BRK]

'Welcome to the jungle, we
got weeds to tame...[BRK]

If they stoke your allergies
well, it's the price you
pay.'[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

What do you think? I just
made that part up! I'll work
on the rest...[BRK]

[POR02]
I can't put my finger right
on it, but that sounds
awfully familiar...[END]

I'm afraid I'm not a very
good dancer. Especially
compared to Jean.[BRK]

But I keep trying. Someday
I hope to dance in one of
the festivals to Althena.[BRK]

[POR08]
Why do they dance at these
festivals to Althena?[BRK]

Did Althena tell them to?
I don't understand any of
this...

=== 50 | e702 | 51 ===
Ohhhh! This is terrible!
Just terrible...The monster
will get us all, eventually![END]

=== 51 | e762 | 92 ===
I'm so happy that you
defeated that loathsome
monster![BRK]

Now, we can all get to the
carnival.[BRK]

[POR10]
Remember, save a spot for
me in the dancing roster![END]

Have you ever seen something
like this baby?[BRK]

It's called a Magic Arrow.
It'll be one of our most
popular attractions.[BRK]

[POR02]
Attractions? Looks more like
an accident waiting to
happen to me![BRK]

[POR00]
Oh no! It's quite safe, I'm
certain.[BRK]

I've got it all worked out
on paper, and we've already
sent monkeys up in it![BRK]

Aside from a little brain
swelling, they're fine.[BRK]

Besides, I think I've fixed
the thing that caused that
anyway...[END]

=== 54 | efdc | 95 ===
If only this Magic Arrow
were bigger! Then everyone
could fly away in it.[BRK]

But it's not, so what shall
we do about this monster?
Oh dear...Oh dear...
[END]

=== 55 | f080 | 108 ===
I'm actually getting too
old for this kind of life.[BRK]

I was toying with the idea
of settling down and giving
up this job.[BRK]

But I'm the only person
that knows how to work the
Magic Arrow...[BRK]

...and it's our number one
attraction! Oh...I don't
know what I'm gonna do...

Hello! Joe the carpetbagger,

Thanks for stopping by! Come
again anytime...if you can
find me![END]
