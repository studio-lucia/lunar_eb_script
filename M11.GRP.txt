Are you lost, folks? This is
the entrance to illusion
woods.[BRK]

People have been known to
go in there and never be
seen again![BRK]

Unless you're desperate to
get to the madoria plains,
i would turn back...[END]

=== 1 | 19abc | 88 ===
Say, folks, you'd be crazy to
try to cross the illusion
woods![BRK]

Only the most skilled can
find their way through the
maze-like interior.
[END]

=== 2 | 19b66 | df ===
Ronfar! You cheatin' dog!
What are you doing here?
Feeling guilty?[BRK]

[POR05]
No, buddy, i'll only feel
guilty if you're dumb enough
to gamble against me again.[BRK]

I warned you not to play
that last round, but did you
listen? Noooo...[END]

=== 3 | 19c48 | 4c ===
[POR05]
C'mon, hiro! We don't have 
time to spare. Let's get
going toward dalton![END]

=== 4 | 19cac | 2a5 ===
Ronfar, you lying dog! I
want a chance to win back
my money![BRK]

[POR05]
C'mon...i don't have
time for this![BRK]

I know you know the way
through the illusion woods.
Tell me how to get through![BRK]

[POR00]
You're not getting one bit
of information from me until
you pay me back![BRK]

I want another chance to win
back my money, buster![BRK]

[POR02]
Geez, this guy's not too
bright, is he?[BRK]

Hasn't he figured out
ronfar's dice are loaded?[BRK]

[POR05]
Okay, but remember, you
asked to play this round![BRK]

We'll play odd and even.
What do you call?[BRK]

[POR00]
Uh...uh...uh...
...just a minute...let
me think...uh...uh...uh...[BRK]

[POR05]
C'mon, woodsman! I don't
have all day! What is it,
odd or even?[BRK]

[POR00]
Uh...uh...uh...okay...i'll
...i'll bet odd![END]

=== 5 | 19f5a | ba ===
[POR05]
[0x4] [0x3] [0x4] [0x3] 
Ha! Even! Sorry buddy,
it looks like i won.[BRK]

[POR00]
Ouuuggg! I know you cheated
me again somehow![BRK]

But a deal's a deal. Here.
I'll enchant you so that the
paths show themselves...
[END]

=== 6 | 1a022 | 168 ===
[POR05]
Whoa! I'll be a dirty...[BRK]

[POR00]
Ha ha ha! Pretty impressive,
huh?[BRK]

Without my special spell, 
the path i've cut through
the woods is invisible![BRK]

These tunnels will lead you
through illusion woods with
a minimum of fuss.[BRK]

...and when you have time,
remember, ronfar...i want a
rematch using my dice![BRK]

[POR05]
Uh...yeaaahh, right.
Whatever you say, old dog.
See ya around![END]

=== 7 | 1a1a6 | 102 ===
What are you doing back
here? I thought you had
important business![BRK]

If you've got time to dally
around here, i want a
rematch![BRK]

[POR05]
Sorry, old pal, i do have
important business. I won't
bother you...[BRK]

[POR00]
Well, carry on, then. But
remember: i want a rematch!



[END]

=== 8 | 1a2c4 | 98 ===
See the hole in the tree to
my left? Isn't the spell I
made wonderful?![BRK]

Anyway, follow the holes
through the maze and you'll
end up on the other side...[END]

=== 9 | 1a378 | 91 ===
Are you lost again? Didn't
i tell you how to get
through last time?[BRK]

Listen! Follow the path
in the trees. It'll lead
you right to the other side![END]

=== a | 1a424 | dd ===
You know, members of
althena's guard were here
looking for ronfar.[BRK]

What did you do to get those
boys mad? I mean, that's
heat you can't afford...[BRK]

[POR05]
Oh, it's nothing, really.
Just a misunderstanding...[BRK]

...
....[BRK]

...really![END]

=== b | 1a518 | 6f ===
Hmmm, where is ronfar? Did
the soldiers of althena's
guard catch him?[BRK]

Ha! Well it serves him right
if they did![END]

=== c | 1a59e | bc ===
You still outwitting those
soldiers from althena's
guard?[BRK]

I'm tellin' you ronfar, your
time's runnin' out![BRK]

[POR05]
Ta ha ha! 'Fraid not, my
backwoods pal! They're not
even close to catchin' me![END]

=== d | 1a66e | 9a ===
If ronfar was strong enough
to save the world, no wonder
i couldn't beat him...[BRK]

[POR02]
Um, i think you have the
facts a little mixed up.
Hiro saved the world![END]

=== e | 1a71c | aa ===
I've quit my little gamblin'
habit and decided to become
a guide for these woods.[BRK]

[POR05]
Sounds like you'll be
holdin' on to a lot more of
your money now, buddy![BRK]

Ha ha ha ha![END]

=== f | 1a7da | 113 ===
[POR09]
She's escaped, but she can't
have gone very far. Lucia
will be mine again![BRK]

I want a low-level search of
every outhouse, dog-house, 
hen-house, tree-house,[BRK]

boat-house, birdhouse, road-
house, and penthouse within
a 20 mile radius.[BRK]

We're gonna get this girl
and her cohorts![END]

=== 10 | 1a8f0 | 72 ===
[POR09]
I won't forget you betrayed
me, ronfar![BRK]

When i catch up to you and
that destroyer, there'll be
hell to pay!



[END]

=== 11 | 1a966 | 39 ===
Sir, i've completed my
search and found no trace
of them.[END]

=== 12 | 1a9a2 | 49 ===
She seems to have vanished
into thin air! There's no
sign of any of them![END]

=== 13 | 1a9ee | d6 ===
The only person we could
find was just a simple
woodsman.[BRK]

No sign of the girl or
the others, sir![BRK]

[POR09]
Damn! I know they're around
here somewhere! I will find
them![BRK]

All right, men! Back to the
destiny...double-speed![END]

[POR02]
Whoa! Check that out! This
hole is so big, there's no
way around it![BRK]

...at least not for you
guys. I can cross, but
you're stuck.[BRK]

We're gonna have to go back.[END]

=== 23 | 2e2f4 | 86 ===
[POR02]
Hiro, this hole is just too
far across. There's no way
you're gonna get across.[BRK]

[POR10]
Wait a minute...maybe there
is a way. Sit tight![END]

=== 24 | 2e384 | 4c ===
[POR10]
There! That should be strong
enough to act as a bridge.[BRK]
