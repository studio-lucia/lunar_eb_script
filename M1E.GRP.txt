Weelllcooome to the village
of Zulan...[BRK]

[POR05]
Knock it off, Grandpa! You
can't scare us with that
gravelly voice.[BRK]

[POR00]
Ronfar, is that you, lad?[BRK]

Well, next time tell me when
you're going to stop by.[BRK]

Why don't you help us?
We're in trouble![END]

=== 1 | 82d8 | 70 ===
I'm tired of your lame 
excuses, son...[BRK]

Why don't you get off your
lazy butt and do something
to stop this foe?
[END]

=== 2 | 835c | 167 ===
I'm tired of looking at your
ugly mug! Get out and stop
this wicked foe...[BRK]

[POR05]
I remember you being a kind
old man. Now I find you're 
just a grumpy old fart.[BRK]

[POR00]
Why I oughtta...! Who are
you callin' old?[BRK]

Just to show you I'm not 
grumpy, you'll find the 
entrance to the cave...[BRK]

just to the east of this
village. Now get a move on,
before I die waiting on ya.[END]

=== 3 | 84d6 | 65 ===
Well, I don't believe it!
You actually did something
I told ya![BRK]

I'm really quite proud of
ya, lad...
[END]

=== 4 | 8548 | 65 ===
[POR05]
Geez, don't go getting all 
emotional on me![BRK]

I just hope you try to be
nicer to me and my friends.[END]

=== 5 | 85c0 | 135 ===
Hello. I just love talking
to people like you...[BRK]

I would like to take this
opportunity to welcome you
to our village.[BRK]

Is that nice enough for you?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Damn little kids! Don't you
know you don't have any
right to criticize my talk?[BRK]

Now get your scrawny little 
butts out of here before I 
throw you out![END]

=== 6 | 870c | 5a ===
Ronfar, wanna play a little
game?[BRK]

Hehe...Why don't you pull
my finger?[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh...no thanks.
[END]

This is the road that leads
to Meribia. All you have to 
do is continue on this path.[BRK]

[POR10]
Meribia lies before me, and 
so does my destiny. Lunn, 
I hope you're there...[BRK]

[POR00]
...I'm sorry, but I can't
let you pass! You must first
help us out...[END]

=== 8 | 887e | 124 ===
Are you looking for your
girlfriend, Lucia?[BRK]

She's already passed through
this exit.[BRK]

Man, I don't understand why
you just let her leave 
without going with her.[BRK]

If I was her, I would want
my boyfriend to always be
close to me.[BRK]

[POR02]
What are you talking about?
Lucia doesn't have a boy-
friend...[END]

=== 9 | 89be | ea ===
Lucia seemed like she was in
a hurry. What does she have
to do in Meribia?[BRK]

[POR02]
Lucia doesn't have anything
to do there! Jean's the one
that has business there![BRK]

[POR10]
Yes, but Ruby, I can't leave
this village like this. They
need our help.[END]

=== a | 8ac4 | bb ===
I think I saw fear in 
Lucia's eyes when she ran
past me...[BRK]

Did you guys have a lover's
quarrel? That always happens
to people in love![BRK]

You guys must be really,
really, really be in love![END]

=== b | 8b8c | 51 ===
[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR02]
Wipe that silly grin off 
your face! I'm telling
Grandpa Gwyn...[END]

=== c | 8bfc | 6d ===
You need a good therapist
to study your fear of
commitment...[BRK]

...At least, that's my
opinion...[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[END]

=== d | 8c80 | 82 ===
Thank you for beating the 
monster. You've lifted the
darkness from our village.[BRK]

Now my wedding can finally
take place. Thank you![END]

=== e | 8d12 | ab ===
I'm told that the marriage
will be this spring. I just
can't wait![BRK]

[POR02]
I'm guessing spring might
have come already for you
two...[BRK]

You look a little too rosy,
if ya ask me!
[END]

=== f | 8dd0 | 136 ===
Aren't you guys freezing?
You're not dressed properly
for this climate.[BRK]

I think this is the coldest
place on our world.[BRK]

Lotsa people complain about
the weather an' other
things,[BRK]

but they really got no right
to complain...[BRK]

Hey...I say, ya got no
reason ta complain 'til
ya get a woman.[BRK]

Then it's complaint city![END]

=== 10 | 8f1e | 37 ===
Well, we're not going to get
married until this spring.[END]

=== 11 | 8f68 | 77 ===
I'm trying to make this 
place into a ski resort.[BRK]

We could have little log
cabins with nice, big
romantic fireplaces...[END]

=== 12 | 8ff2 | 14e ===
Now that the weather's more
moderate and the beast is
gone,[BRK]

the ski resort I want to
create looks like a definite
possibility...[BRK]

If this place does become a
ski resort, I'm going to
own all the cabins.[BRK]

But I haven't decided if I
should rent them by the day
or the hour...[BRK]

I guess it depends on what
kind of crowd I want to 
attract...[END]

=== 13 | 9154 | d6 ===
Now that you've killed the
beast, I have the chance to
turn my dream into reality.[BRK]

The girl that has stolen my
heart will finally be mine![BRK]

She's hoping for a spring
wedding. I want to make her
dream a reality, too.[END]

=== 14 | 9242 | 8b ===
You guys have really helped
us out of this troubling
situation...[BRK]

When I build my cabins, I'll
let you stay for free. You
gotta come back!![END]

=== 15 | 92e0 | 6f ===
Welcome to the little icicle
we like to call home.[BRK]

You guys okay? You look like
you've never seen snow 
before.[END]

=== 16 | 935c | 91 ===
[POR10]
I've never seen snow like 
this before. Have you,
Lucia?[BRK]

[POR08]
This place reminds me of the
Blue Star.[BRK]

The cold and overwhelming
calm is eerie...[END]

=== 17 | 9404 | 113 ===
You guys should get used to
the cold or your stay is 
going to be very unpleasant.[BRK]

[POR02]
Well, duh! Tell me something
I don't know![BRK]

You know, maybe I could
start a fire to warm us
up a bit...[BRK]

[POR05]
That's one gamble I don't
want to take![BRK]

Knowing you, it'd be outta
hand in no time![END]

=== 18 | 952a | 93 ===
I just don't know how to 
thank you guys for defeating
the monster.[BRK]

[POR02]
Geez, it's still freezing
here! I thought it would
warm up once he was dead.[END]

=== 19 | 95ca | 3a ===
[POR10]
Ruby, you shouldn't be cold
wrapped up in all that fur![END]

=== 1a | 9614 | a3 ===
You know, there's this nice
guy named Ramus that wants
to turn this place into...[BRK]

a nice little tourist trap.[BRK]

By tripling our prices,
we'll really rake it in.




[END]

=== 1b | 96c4 | 89 ===
[POR07]
I knew Ramus would go to 
any lengths to win our
little bet![BRK]

But this is really too
much! I can't imagine being
married to that dweeb![END]

=== 1c | 9760 | 26e ===
This has got to be the worst
job in the world! I hate
shoveling snow![BRK]

Oooughh...What I wouldn't
give for someone to do all
this work for me![BRK]

[POR07]
No...It couldn't be that
easy....[BRK]

Ha!...Yes!![BRK]

I've got a great idea for
a new business.[BRK]

This is going to make a ton
of money![BRK]

Now, in order to make this 
business profitable I'm 
going to need you, Ruby.[BRK]

[POR02]
My help?[BRK]

Ouuhhhh...I get it![BRK]

You want me to melt all the
snow with my breath, don't
you?[BRK]

[POR07]
Correctamundo! With your
breath and my brains we're
going to be rich.[BRK]

[POR02]
Read my lips...[BRK]

No.[BRK]

Way!!!!![BRK]

With your hare-brained
scheme, I do all the work,
and you get all the dough!![END]

=== 1d | 99e6 | a5 ===
Geez, what I wouldn't give
for some help in clearing
all this snow...[BRK]

[POR07]
I'll help! But I have to
charge you like 1,000s an
hour...[BRK]

You know...Union and all
that...
[END]

=== 1e | 9a9e | 131 ===
I've had enough of this 
snow! I'm leaving to live
in the desert.[BRK]

The ground'll be so hot I'll
be jumping barefoot like a
jumpin' jack...[BRK]

I'll be pickin'...peelin'...
...burnin'...screamin'...
...itchin'...feelin'[BRK]

...hot! Hot! Hot!!![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...But at least there'll be
no more of this damned snow!



[END]

=== 1f | 9bde | 64 ===
I've already made my plans
to get out of this place.[BRK]

And thanks to you, the path
outta here is safe![END]

=== 20 | 9c56 | b6 ===
This is the best winter 
we've had in years![BRK]

Just think of the summer
we're going to have when
this starts to melt!![BRK]

All the mud will make it
perfect for monster horse-
cart pulls!!![END]

=== 21 | 9d24 | a8 ===
I think we should start
digging a big hole in the
middle of the town...[BRK]

We can shovel all the snow
in there, and when the sun
melts it, it'll be a lake.[BRK]

Cool idea, huh?[END]

=== 22 | 9de0 | 75 ===
We can make the biggest
man-made lake in history![BRK]

I just haven't worked out
what I'm going to do with
all the dirt...[END]

=== 23 | 9e64 | 81 ===
Did you hear that some of
the villagers want to make
this into a resort?[BRK]

Shoot! Why didn't I think
of doing something like 
that?[END]

=== 24 | 9ef8 | b0 ===
People are trying to get out
of this snowy country, but
I'm going to stay here.[BRK]

I'm a member of the Freezing
Blathering Idiot Swim Club.[BRK]

Wanna join? I can get you a
discount...[END]

=== 25 | 9fc0 | 96 ===
Every year, about this time,
we see who can stay in the
ice water the longest.[BRK]

I won last year, but it took
me 27 weeks to recover from
the frostbite.[END]

=== 26 | a06a | 8a ===
Some think that we're insane
to go out in our skivvies
and swim in the water.[BRK]

I think it's the only way to
prove our superior man-
liness![END]

=== 27 | a104 | e9 ===
When all this snow melts,
I'm going to sell it as 
mineral water.[BRK]

I'll call it Zulan Magic
Tonic.  I know it'll be
a big hit![BRK]

[POR02]
Who would want to buy water
that came from snow?[BRK]

And besides, isn't most of
the snow around here yellow?[END]

=== 28 | a1fa | d6 ===
[POR07]
Shut up Ruby! Listen, I
know a place where we can
sell a million of these![BRK]

Say there, sir, would you
like to sign this
distribution agreement?[BRK]

[POR02]
Man, Lemina, don't you
ever stop trying to spin
gold from manure?[END]

=== 29 | a2e4 | 18b ===
This winter has really 
killed my fishing business.[BRK]

The only good thing to come
from it is that I'm starting
a fish-cream business...[BRK]

Looks like ice cream, but
with all the youth enhancing
benefits of fish oil![BRK]

[POR07]
Yuck! Who would want to eat
that crap? Sounds terrible![BRK]

[POR00]
Well, it's not like I wanted
your opinion![BRK]

Besides my business is going
to make me filthy rich.[BRK]

Just wait...You'll see...
[END]

=== 2a | a486 | 6b ===
This monster thing is 
really ruining our local
economy.[BRK]

I mean, this is the coldest
winter we've ever had![END]

=== 2b | a4fe | 35 ===
[POR08]
The monster...Zophar must
be behind all of this...[END]

=== 2c | a54a | 14a ===
I don't know how to thank
you for finally killing 
that icy beast![BRK]

Now I can start to plan how
I'm going to invest all of
my money...[BRK]

You didn't, by chance, scalp
him or get anything from his
cave did you?[BRK]

What!!!??? You didn't get
anything off him???!!![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, I'm so sorry. I was
more concerned about saving
this little icehole.[END]

=== 2d | a6b0 | 86 ===
Great! You save us, but
you don't bring back any
souvenirs![BRK]

What good is a dead monster
if I don't have his head
mounted on my wall??![END]

=== 2e | a746 | 55 ===
I heard that the battle for
our world was almost lost![BRK]

That would have been
terrible![END]

=== 2f | a7ae | 63 ===
I'll be drippin'....freezin'
...coughin'...wheezin'....
....fevered feelin'...[BRK]

...cold, cold, cold![END]

=== 30 | a828 | 7e ===
...Still got to keep...
...moving...can't stop...[BRK]

Oohhhh...What I wouldn't
give to be strapped to a
furnace right about now...[END]

=== 31 | a8ba | 62 ===
I should have put my
shoes on before I came out
this morning![BRK]

At least then I could
stop moving...[END]

=== 32 | a92c | 51 ===
Man, oh man...I can't wait
'til this summer![BRK]

The bods, the studs,
the sun...Wow!
[END]

=== 33 | a98c | 26 ===
Heelllp meee! My butt is
frozen solid![END]

=== 34 | a9ce | 3f ===
I'm starting to get feeling
in my left cheek again![BRK]

Thank you!![END]

=== 35 | aa1a | 4b ===
I'm getting tired of that
stupid girl running back
and forth all the time!
[END]

=== 36 | aa84 | 76 ===
I've been trying to get to
first base with that girl,
but I can't...[BRK]

She says it's because I
don't understand women...[END]

=== 37 | ab08 | 38 ===
[POR05]
Don't worry, kid. There's
not a man alive that does.
[END]

=== 38 | ab60 | 4b ===
I've been reading books 
about women. I think I'll
finally get to date her.[END]

=== 39 | abba | 5c ===
I can't believe it! She 
shot down my best pick-up
line![BRK]

Are girls worth this much 
trouble?[END]

=== 3a | ac2a | fd ===
Zzzzz...zzzzzz...Please just
let me sleeeep...[BRK]

Listen, stupid, if you fall
asleep now you'll never
wake up![BRK]

<whack> <slam> <bam!>
I won't let you die on me![BRK]

Now wake up!![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Come on, talk to Johnny![BRK]

[POR05]
Geez, the dumb games kids
play nowadays...
[END]

=== 3b | ad3e | 2e ===
Do you want these people to
eat you? Wake up!![END]

=== 3c | ad84 | 6e ===
If it's the last thing I do
I'm going to make sure you
stay awake!![BRK]

Only the weak and the stupid
fall asleep!![END]

=== 3d | ae0a | 89 ===
Zzzzz....zzzzz....I don't
care. Go ahead and eat me.[BRK]

I'm willing to sacrifice
my tasty left calf so you
can live...[BRK]

Take it...I insist...[END]

=== 3e | aea2 | 77 ===
I hated playing that stupid
game of being trapped on the
icy snow pass...[BRK]

Next time, I get to be the
guy that survives![END]

=== 3f | af2c | 42 ===
I thought I told you it was
my turn to survive the 
balloon crash![END]

=== 40 | af86 | 4f ===
If I don't get to play the
hero this time, then I'm not
going to play with you![END]

=== 41 | afec | 56 ===
I can't believe you think 
only you can be the hero![BRK]

Mommy! Johnny isn't playing
fair![END]

=== 42 | b05e | 3b ===
If we're going to play
'Donner Party', at least
play right![END]

=== 43 | b0a8 | 7d ===
Howdy. Do you wanna play pin
the monster head on the ugly
boy?![BRK]

So what if it isn't nice?! 
At least it's a fun game to
play![END]

=== 44 | b138 | a3 ===
Can you believe I got stuck
with this paper route?[BRK]

Half the people here don't
have subscriptions to the
paper...[BRK]

And the other half just
don't care about the news![END]

=== 45 | b1ea | 6f ===
If I don't get twelve new
subscriptions I won't get
to be paper boy of month.[BRK]

I really hate being a paper-
boy![END]

=== 46 | b26c | 88 ===
People think that if you're
born in the cold weather,
you'll get used to it...[BRK]

I'd like to punch out 
the guy that said that
nonsense...[END]

=== 47 | b30c | 42 ===
I can't believe my friends
talked me into moving here
with them...[END]

=== 48 | b366 | d2 ===
Man, is it getting hot in
this town or what?[BRK]

[POR02]
What are you talking about?
This place is freezing![BRK]

[POR00]
This isn't cold. I think
I'm going to put on my
shorts.[BRK]

[POR02]
You stupid hicks deserve
to live in an icebox!

[END]

=== 49 | b454 | 71 ===
Take a breath of that cool
mountain air. That'll make
you high on life.[BRK]

[POR02]
Yeah, after it freezes your
lungs out![END]

=== 4a | b4d4 | 6d ===
Due to the warm weather,
we've started to plant our
gardens.[BRK]

This is going to be a 
great year for botanists![END]

=== 4b | b550 | 94 ===
Man alive! I can't believe
how cold this place is...[BRK]

I'm thinking of becoming a
career sinner.[BRK]

That way, I'll get sent
straight to a warmer
climate.[END]

=== 4c | b5f8 | 76 ===
I've repented of my wicked
ways since it's become so
warm here![BRK]

[POR02]
Warm?!! This place is like
the inside of a freezer![END]

=== 4d | b67c | 98 ===
[POR05]
I don't understand why 
you're cold, Ruby. All that
fur oughtta keep you warm.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm sorry, but this fur just
doesn't cut it in these 
kinda places.[END]

=== 4e | b724 | 8f ===
With the heat wave we're
having, they closed down
the ski operations...[BRK]

Man, I wish that monster was
still alive. At least we 
could still ski![END]

Zulan Village[END]

The mayor is upstairs with
his sickly grandchild.[BRK]

I don't know if it's wise
to disturb him right now. [END]

=== 51 | d32c | 5a ===
The mayor's upstairs with
his grandchild.[BRK]

He's in much better spirits
since she recovered.[END]

=== 52 | d396 | 6b ===
The mayor is upstairs
working on his plans to
turn Zulan into a resort.[BRK]

It all sounds very glamorous
to me.[END]

=== 53 | d414 | bb ===
If I were a little bigger,
I would ram a spear down
that monster's throat![BRK]

That way, my friend could
get well again.[BRK]

It sucks being a kid at
times like this. You just
feel so powerless...[END]

=== 54 | d4e6 | 66 ===
If I were all grown up, I'd
whip that monster's butt in
a second![BRK]

In fact, I think I'll try it
anyway![END]

=== 55 | d560 | e5 ===
I just feel so helpless that
nothing I do seems to make
a difference.[BRK]

I wish I could help you
defeat that monster. [BRK]

You are going to try to 
defeat it, aren't you?[BRK]

It's the only way to make
the mayor's granddaughter
well again...[END]

=== 56 | d65c | b8 ===
Thank you for slaying the
monster to free my girl-
friend.[BRK]

When I grow up, I want to
be just like you...[BRK]

Or Eddie Vedder...I haven't
really decided yet.[BRK]

At least you're in the
running![END]

=== 57 | d72c | 43 ===
Pretty soon, I'm gonna be
big enough to protect this
whole village![END]

=== 58 | d782 | 113 ===
I'm so happy to know that
there are people in this
world like you.[BRK]

Not only did you save my
girlfriend, but you saved
the world, too![BRK]

Do you think the power of
love is strong enough to
safeguard us forever?[BRK]

[POR02]
I don't know about forever,
but it sure makes for a nice
start...[END]

=== 59 | d8ac | 89 ===
It's really wonderful when
you find the one you're

There's no feeling in the

Oh, thank the Goddess! She
has heard my prayers and
sent you to save us.[BRK]

I know that you've come a 
great distance to be here 
with us today...[BRK]

But please! There is no
time to waste. You must
defeat this wicked creature.[BRK]

The monster has made us 
prisoners in our own homes.[BRK]

This cold weather that it
has brought upon us has 
already killed many people.[BRK]

Please! I beg of you, will
you please help us?[BRK]

If you won't do it for me,
please do it for my grand- 
daughter...[BRK]

She's all I have left. Will
you please help us?

[END]

=== 5c | e236 | 34 ===
[0x5]That beast is history!
I'm tired of helping people.[END]

Oh, you have no idea how 
happy you've made me.[BRK]

As the mayor, I'll make
sure you receive everything
you need.[END]

=== 5e | e2f0 | 159 ===
[POR08]
Hiro, this is not a decision
you can make for all of us.[BRK]

Even if you take the time
to save this village...[BRK]

We've wasted valuable time 
in trying to stop the 
revival of Zophar.[BRK]

I know that you'll want to
help these people. I can no
longer stay with you...[BRK]

My mission is too important.
I suppose this is to be
our good-bye...[BRK]

...Thank you...

Lucia would turn her back

so...heartless![BRK]

The girl seemed to have
pressing business.[BRK]

Thankfully, you were able
to stay even though she
left.[BRK]

You hurry to the monster
cave above this village.[BRK]

I wish I could tell you what
to expect inside,[BRK]

but everyone who's been
inside has come back with
only sketchy details.

self-centered?[BRK]

These people need our help!
Come on...Let's help them.[END]

We've tried everything in
our power to kill this

Please think it over one
more time. We really need
your help.[END]

The boy guarding the
entrance to the cave will
let you in.[END]

My granddaughter and myself
thank you from the bottom
of our hearts.[BRK]

[POR07]
Mr. Mayor, I'm Lemina the
Junior Premier of the Magic
Guild of Vane.[BRK]

I would like to present
you with this bill for our
extermination services...[BRK]

[POR02]
Lemina! You can't charge
these people for killing 
the monster![BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! Where is that written
in stone?[BRK]

I'm telling you that they
will pay us a ton of Silver
for what we've done!![END]

=== 64 | e984 | 7e ===
Once again, I can't thank
you enough for saving my
village...[BRK]

[POR07]
Well, just remember that
next time I'm going to
charge you...[END]

=== 65 | ea16 | 7d ===
With the warmth that the
village is experiencing,[BRK]

my granddaughter's fever
broke last night. I think 
she's going to make it.[END]

=== 66 | eaa0 | 89 ===
[POR07]
Just remember, if you ever
need any help,[BRK]

the Vane Magic Guild will
always be here to help you.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

For a small fee, of course.[END]

=== 67 | eb3c | 7b ===
We're really starting to
turn this village around![BRK]

Ramus was here yesterday,
and he said we should make
this into a resort.[END]

=== 68 | ebce | 4f ===
Ramus is nothing but a
moneymaking machine.[BRK]

The kid's got a brain
for bucks...
[END]

=== 69 | ec2a | 3e ===
[POR07]
Pooh! If Ramus keeps making
money like this, I'm a
goner...[END]

=== 6a | ec78 | ce ===
I...I'm...s-s-s...so...
v-v-v-very...c-c-c-cold...[BRK]

Momma...where...are...
you...?[BRK]

[POR02]
Poor thing...She's freezing
to death...[BRK]

And she's got a very high
temperature. I don't think
she's going to make it...


[END]

=== 6b | ed5a | 6a ===
P-P-P-Please...you...
g-g-g-got...t-t-t-to...
help...m-m-me...[BRK]

[POR02]
Come on, we've got to
save this girl!!

[END]

=== 6c | eddc | 70 ===
My head doesn't feel so
hot anymore...Thank you.[BRK]

[POR07]
You know, somehow that 
'thank you' makes it all
worthwhile.[END]

=== 6d | ee64 | 78 ===
Grandpa promised me that
soon I'll be able to get
up and play...[BRK]

I hope that you'll come and
see me when I'm all better.[END]

=== 6e | eef0 | b1 ===
I had a dream last night. 
You and Lucia were in it.[BRK]

I dreamt that Lucia was in
a place colder than this...[BRK]

And somehow you found a way
to be with her.[BRK]

Crazy, huh?[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[END]

=== 6f | efb8 | 4f ===
What's happened to Lucia?
Why isn't she with you 
anymore?[BRK]

[POR02]
She's...gone...

[END]

=== 70 | f016 | 7a ===
This is the mayor's house.
But he hasn't been outside
in days...[BRK]

I think it has something to
do with his granddaughter...
[END]

=== 71 | f0a4 | b2 ===
So the old man talked you
into saving our little 
village, did he?[BRK]

He's always been a great
salesman.[BRK]

I just hope you didn't get
suckered into giving your
lives for this village.[END]

=== 72 | f16a | 55 ===
...I don't believe it![BRK]

I can't believe you're 
back. I guess the old man
was right...[END]

=== 73 | f1ce | 47 ===
Now that spring is here,
everyone is in a better
mood.[BRK]

Don't you agree?[END]

=== 74 | f222 | 40 ===
[POR07]
Like, maybe they're in the
mood to donate to the Magic
Guild?[END]

=== 75 | f276 | b3 ===
Each day she keeps getting
worse...[BRK]

I don't think my daughter
has the strength to fight
the fever anymore...[BRK]

I don't know what I'm going
to do...[BRK]

She's the only child I have
left![END]

=== 76 | f340 | 4b ===
Her father has left the 
village to find a cure, but
he's never returned...[END]

=== 77 | f39e | 6a ===
I've done nothing but pray
to the Goddess to help us
find a cure...[BRK]

Yet my prayers still go
unanswered...
[END]

=== 78 | f41c | 74 ===
Ohh, the Goddess has finally
answered my prayers![BRK]

My daughter's going to live!
I just don't know how to
thank you...[END]

=== 79 | f4a0 | 50 ===
My husband finally returned
last night.[BRK]

He's so grateful for what
you've done...[END]

=== 7a | f500 | f0 ===
I want to thank you for
saving my daughter's life.[BRK]

Words cannot express how
happy I am. Just seeing her
laugh brings me great joy![BRK]

I just don't know what I
would've done if she'd
died...[BRK]

But thanks to you, I don't
have to think about that.
[END]

=== 7b | f600 | da ===
Damn that monster! If he'd
fight fair, I would've beat
him to a bloody pulp...[BRK]

Here's a tip, if you think
you want to try to fight
it...[BRK]

Watch out! He fights real
dirty! After he kneed me in
the groin, I was history...[END]

=== 7c | f6ee | 80 ===
There's no way you can win
a fight with the beast
without me...[BRK]

Why don't you wait until I
feel better? Then I can go
with you.
[END]

=== 7d | f786 | 72 ===
What!? You defeated the
beast!?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

The only reason you defeated
him was because I softened
him up for you![END]

=== 7e | f80a | 38 ===
[POR02]
Oh yeah, he sure looked like
he was on his death bed.[END]

=== 7f | f85e | 69 ===
I don't know why everyone is
thanking you. If it wasn't
for me you would've lost![BRK]

[POR02]
Give it a rest, pal![END]

=== 80 | f8d6 | bc ===
I don't want to hear how 
great you guys think you 
are.[BRK]

We both know who killed that
monster...[BRK]

[POR02]
If you killed it...[BRK]

It was because it died
laughing at you, you sorry
excuse for a man.
[END]

=== 81 | f9a2 | 83 ===
I've killed a bear with my
bare hands.[BRK]

I've killed every kind of 
beast known to man...[BRK]

But this thing...Be afraid.
Be very afraid![END]

=== 82 | fa38 | 66 ===
You mustn't go there. He'll
kill you.[BRK]

The beast knows no mercy.
It thrives on killing
innocent people.[END]

=== 83 | fab6 | 95 ===
I heard that the beast tried
to kill you in an avalanche.
How'd you escape?[BRK]

[POR02]
Lucia helped us out of that
little mess, and just in the
nick of time![END]

=== 84 | fb60 | 40 ===
[POR08]
There wasn't any 'Nick'
present...what are you
talking about?[END]

=== 85 | fbbc | 61 ===
With all this cold weather,
I don't think I'll ever get
better!![BRK]

...I really hate that 
monster.
[END]

=== 86 | fc2c | 6d ===
If I could've killed that
beast, I would've ripped his
spleen out with my teeth.[BRK]

...Uh, if it had a spleen...[END]

=== 87 | fca8 | 6e ===
P...Please, could you go 
and fetch me a glass of
water?[BRK]

[POR02]
You're injured, but not
that bad! Get it yourself![END]

=== 88 | fd2e | 154 ===
I...was in a terrible...
fight...the beast...
I'm injured...[BRK]

I'm in terrible pain. Would
you please go get me 
something to eat?[BRK]

[POR02]
You don't look like you got
beaten up by the beast.[BRK]

[POR00]
Well, no...I...I didn't
exactly fight with the
monster...[BRK]

I...f-fell down when I was 
trying to run away from it.[BRK]

[POR02]
....
.....[BRK]

I knew it!! You coward!!
[END]

=== 89 | fe9e | 67 ===
Please promise me that you
won't tell anyone about
how I got hurt.[BRK]

They'll never let me live
it down...[END]

=== 8a | ff18 | 36 ===
The mayor is going to give
me a reward for my heroism.[END]

=== 8b | ff62 | 58 ===
My wounds are finally
healing.[BRK]

The doc said I should be out
of here in a couple of days.[END]

=== 8c | ffd2 | 51 ===
I've joined the track team
here. Next time I run away 
I'm not going to get hurt.[END]

Zulan Mayor 2F[END]

=== 8e | 1077a | 52 ===
Ah! Come in! Come in! Get
yourself out of the snow and
let me show you my wares...[END]

=== 8f | 107d6 | 50 ===
I really appreciate your
patronage. Remember to stop
here for all your supplies![END]

=== 90 | 1082c | f ===
Zulan Item Shop[END]

=== 91 | 10fa6 | 45 ===
Boy, it's cold today, isn't
it? Tell me, what is it I
can do for you?[END]

=== 92 | 10ff4 | 28 ===
Thank you, thank you! Please
call again.[END]

=== 93 | 11022 | 3d ===
We buy and sell only armor
in this shop. What can I
show you?[END]

=== 94 | 11068 | 3a ===
Pleasure doing business with
you today! Please come
again.[END]

=== 95 | 110a8 | c ===
Zulan Bazaar[END]

=== 96 | 1190e | 92 ===
When I promised to marry my
man, he promised we'd never
be cold.[BRK]

Ha! What a liar! This is the
coldest town I've ever seen![BRK]

Oh, why'd we move here?[END]

=== 97 | 119b4 | 92 ===
I guess I have no choice but
to make the best of living
here.[BRK]

I promised to stick with him
for better or worse. I guess
this qualifies as worse...[END]

=== 98 | 11a54 | 46 ===
[POR10]
Look at it this way...At
least you have someone to
snuggle up with![END]

=== 99 | 11aaa | 8c ===
Now that the work in the
fields has started, my man
is gone all day long.[BRK]

At least if there was snow,
he'd be able to stay around
the house.[END]

=== 9a | 11b4a | 9a ===
What am I going to do? The
winter isn't close to being
over, and our food is low![BRK]

My wife doesn't know how bad
this situation is...We're in
big trouble...[END]

=== 9b | 11bfc | 5d ===
Boy! My wife is really in a
bad mood lately! I think
it's cabin fever...[BRK]

..........or PMS....[END]

=== 9c | 11c6c | 4c ===
You know, I was thinking
about starting a sno-cone
stand.[BRK]

What do you think?[END]

=== 9d | 11cc8 | 98 ===
Now that the weather is
good, I have to work hard so
we'll have food next winter.[BRK]

I don't want a repeat of
last winter's tight food
supply. No sireee...[END]
