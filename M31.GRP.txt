Whoa...hiro! Look at this
place...it's fantastic![BRK]

[POR08]
Althena must be nearby, but
i do not yet sense her
presence...[BRK]

...it's so...strange...[BRK]

Hopefully it is not too
late to stop zophar and
save both our worlds.[BRK]

But...that means...[BRK]

=== 1 | 863c | 7d ===
This is the holy sanctuary
where the goddess resides.[BRK]

If you do anything to upset
the goddess, she'll
destroy you in a flash![END]

=== 2 | 86be | 7f ===
I've been in pentagulia
all this time and i've
never seen the goddess.[BRK]

I just hope i can get
one glimpse of her before
i die...[END]

=== 3 | 8742 | 38 ===
This tower was constructed
in honor of white knight
leo.[END]

=== 4 | 8780 | 42 ===
The tower before you was
constructed in honor of
red priest mauri.[END]

=== 5 | 87c8 | 67 ===
I have been assigned to
stand guard over this tower
by master lunn.[BRK]

The tower was erected in
his honor.[END]

=== 6 | 8834 | 10c ===
This is the entrance to the
black tower.[BRK]

It was constructed in honor
of grand black wizard
borgan.[BRK]

We hate it when he comes
to pentagulia to inspect
his tower...[BRK]

...because we have to grease
the door frame to get him
inside.[BRK]

The guy's a fat pig...no
two ways about it.[END]

=== 7 | 8950 | 7d ===
I haven't seen you before.
Are you new here?[BRK]

Goddess althena must be
very fond of you,[BRK]

for only the most holy are
allowed in.[END]

=== 8 | 89e0 | 81 ===
I think althena has the
right idea in keeping the
riff-raff out.[BRK]

Thank althena there is
no concept of civil
liberties in lunar...[END]

=== 9 | 8a70 | e0 ===
I have never seen one bring
such a fantastic gift before
the goddess![BRK]

Are you going to sacrifice
the flying cat in exchange
for her favor?[BRK]

[POR02]
I think someone's already
sacrificed your brain![BRK]

What do you think we are,
stupid?[END]

=== a | 8b64 | e2 ===
I believe that althena will
find pleasure in the cat
you brought to sacrifice.[BRK]

You wouldn't consider
selling it to me, would
you?[BRK]

[POR02]
Stop laughing, hiro! This
is serious![BRK]

This moron wants to kill
me! It's no laughing matter!

[END]

=== b | 8c56 | b5 ===
We all could learn much from
the goddess althena.[BRK]

Her love has spread even to
ghaleon, who once enslaved
her.[BRK]

Now he walks freely about
her great city.[BRK]

Is there no end to her love?
[END]

=== c | 8d1e | b4 ===
It's amazing that althena
allows ghaleon to be here.[BRK]

You know, once before, he
even tried to kill her
beloved dragonmaster![BRK]

[POR02]
Why would she risk that?
Isn't ghaleon pure evil?



[END]

=== d | 8de2 | 76 ===
Althena comes to our world
as a human only once in a
great while.[BRK]

I am fortunate that she has
come during my lifetime![END]

=== e | 8e6c | 56 ===
Will you lay down your
life for the goddess
althena?[BRK]

Someday it may be asked of
you...[END]

=== f | 8ed2 | 8d ===
How dare you bring this
filthy animal into our
holy city![BRK]

Its presence will not be
tolerated![BRK]

[POR02]
I am not an animal. I'm a
red dragon, idiot![END]

=== 10 | 8f72 | c5 ===
Mauri does not serve 
pathetic little cats with
delusions of grandeur.[BRK]

When she finds out what
you're saying, she'll kill
you![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh yeah...well i got 
something to say about that![BRK]

......bite me!!
[END]

=== 11 | 9046 | ae ===
We have been selected by the 
goddess to administer her 
teachings to this world.[BRK]

Althena has chosen us from
amongst many,[BRK]

and we all take this
responsibility very
seriously.[END]

=== 12 | 9108 | 81 ===
The only thing that keeps me
going is the hope that one
day, if i'm good enough,[BRK]

she will bless my work and
grant me immortality.[END]

=== 13 | 9198 | 14c ===
Only the most holy priests
are allowed within the
confines of pentagulia,[BRK]

although althena sometimes
makes allowances for those
that donate large sums.[BRK]

What? Me? Yes, i am a
priest...[BRK]

But it was not always so.
In my former life, i was but
a simple merchant.[BRK]

I was allowed to enter
pentagulia only after I
made a sizable donation...
[END]

=== 14 | 92f8 | 97 ===
Althena is not supposed to
be interested in the wealth
of humans.[BRK]

However, the priests here
have taught me differently.[BRK]

They have shown me the
light...[END]

=== 15 | 939e | 19b ===
The greatest joy that i have
experienced has been during
my time here.[BRK]

The thought that the goddess
herself resides here
sends chills down my spine.[BRK]

[POR02]
This place sends chills down
my spine, too.[BRK]

But i think it's because
this joint's so spooky![BRK]

I mean...listen to that
music...where the hell is
that coming from?[BRK]

Do they pipe it in?[BRK]

I mean, i'm just waiting for
lon chaney to pop up any
minute![BRK]

Creeeeeppppyyy!
[END]

=== 16 | 954c | 70 ===
Look towards the heavens
and bask in the glow of
goddess althena's love.[BRK]

Only then will you know
true happiness.[END]

The holy city of pentagulia
stands before you![BRK]

This is the crown jewel of
althena's cult.[END]

=== 19 | b9c8 | 90 ===
[POR08]
Zophar's immediate goal will
be to seize althena's power.[BRK]

We must find her before he
can accomplish that.[BRK]

Time is running out. We
must hurry![END]

=== 1a | ba7c | 66 ===
[ROR09]
I will do my best to secure
an audience with althena.[BRK]

However, i cannot promise
you i will succeed.[END]

[ROR08]
Oh no! Ghaleon![END]

=== 1c | bb2c | 5e ===
[ROR08]
How is it that you have
come to this holy city?[BRK]

Althena's power should have
prevented this![END]

=== 1d | bb8e | 2de ===
[ROR09]
Ah! Master ghaleon! This
is an unexpected pleasure.[BRK]

[ROR01]
....!?[BRK]

[ROR08]
Master ghaleon? You mean to
say that he is welcome here?[BRK]

Althena has sanctioned your
actions?[BRK]

[ROR09]
Master ghaleon, i was
ordered to bring lucia to
justice.[BRK]

I have brought her to
pentagulia so that althena
may decide her fate.[BRK]

[ROR14]
Ah, but i know all that.[BRK]

For you see, at althena's
behest i have been following
lucia's progress.[BRK]

[ROR09]
...following!?[BRK]

[ROR14]
I have noted that your
dedication to the goddess
has become...er....[BRK]

...questionable.[BRK]

[ROR09]
How can you say that! I have
done everything asked of
me by the goddess![BRK]

[ROR14]
Ah, yes. Well then, i'm sure
you'll do your best to take
the girl to the goddess.[BRK]

...and then the real show
will begin...hm, hm, hm.
Hm, hm, hm, hm,...

This is very strange. I
must find out what's going
on before you arrive.[BRK]

Something is terribly
wrong![END]

[ROR02]
Leo!.......wait!
Where are you going?[BRK]

How are we supposed to
find althena's sanctuary?![END]

=== 20 | bf4a | 1fc ===
[POR05]
Well, this is the end of
my bargain, too.[BRK]

I saw you through to penta-
gulia. Now, i've got some
business of my own.[BRK]

Don't worry. Leo will see
to it that you find the
goddess.[BRK]

I've got to go see mauri.[BRK]

Hate to say it, but good-
bye, hiro...good-bye, lucia.[BRK]

[POR02]
How rude! Aren't you goin'
to say good-bye to me too?[BRK]

[POR05]
Hahaha...oh yes, how could
i forget?[BRK]

Good-bye, ruby! Make sure
you keep a rein on that
fire of yours![BRK]

[POR02]
I'll save all my fire for
you![BRK]

[POR05]
Don't ever change, squirt!
I guess this is adios!

[POR08]
I don't think i've ever
felt feelings like this
before...[BRK]

It's as if there's a 
deep hole inside me...[BRK]

[POR02]
Lucia, everyone has that
feeling when someone you
care about leaves.[BRK]

It's called loneliness,
or even sadness.[BRK]

[POR08]
...so...this hole in my
heart...this empty space...
...is sadness?[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Then, yes...i feel sad that
everyone has left.

[END]

=== 23 | c32e | 18d ===
[POR10]
I have to go and see master
lunn now...[BRK]

Maybe he can shed some
light on my encounter with
the blue dragon cult leader.[BRK]

I must find out who he
really is...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I'm going to miss all of you
very much.[BRK]

Once you've finished every-
thing, come to the carnival
and see me again![BRK]

[POR02]
...okay! I just can't wait
to see you dance again!![BRK]

[POR10]
When you come, ruby, i'll
do a special dance for you!


[END]

=== 24 | c4ea | 2da ===
[POR07]
I guess i'd better be taking
off, too.[BRK]

I've got to have a few words
with that creep borgan![BRK]

If you do happen to see the
goddess,[BRK]

would you ask her if she
would like to donate some
money or luck to the guild?[BRK]

After all, she was the one
that destroyed vane in the
first place.[BRK]

[POR08]
But wasn't she under master
ghaleon's control?[BRK]

[POR07]
Yeah, yeah, yeah...okay,
so she was under ghaleon's
control. Same diff.[BRK]

Point is, it'd be nice if
she helped rebuild it.[BRK]

Anyway, whether you get the
goods or not, you have to
come back to vane.[BRK]

I want you in my magic
guild for mega-sure![BRK]

[POR08]
But lemina, i don't think
that will be possible, you
see...[BRK]

[POR07]
Yes, yes, don't worry! We'll
figure something out, lucia.[BRK]

Anyway, i'd better go. Wish
me luck!

feeling about this![BRK]
