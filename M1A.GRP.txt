[POR02]
Ha! I found you![BRK]

[POR11]
Back in the forest, i warned
you to turn around and leave
this place![BRK]

You'll be sorry you didn't
listen! Dragon kids, at the
ready![END]

=== 1 | b58a | 18c ===
[POR11]
Hey, will you look at that!
I guess you can't escape now
even if you wanted to![BRK]

My dragon kids will keep you
here until i decide what to
do with you.[BRK]

Kids, keep these people from
escaping at any cost. That's
an order![BRK]

[POR00]
Yes, nall!...it won't be
any problem.[BRK]

They look too stupid and
weak to cause any trouble.[BRK]

[POR11]
Don't judge them by their
appearance. They're agents
of the blue dragon cult!

[END]

=== 2 | b71a | 2ac ===
[POR10]
Blue dragon cult? What did
he mean by that? What's
going on?[BRK]

[POR07]
These must be the bandits of
taben's peak! But this dump
is their hideout?[BRK]

[POR05]
Bandits? Whoa there, pumpkin
pants! They're just kids![BRK]

[POR08]
So, you are saying that in
this world, children are
forbidden to be bandits?[BRK]

That's very interesting. Who
enforces this rule? I have
never heard of it.[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, come on! Geez, lucia! Do
ya have to take everything
so literally??!![BRK]

Ronfar just meant that it
seems weird that these kids
could be bandits.[BRK]

No hidden meanings, no
rules. Just an observation.
Get with the program![BRK]

[POR08]
Yes, yes! I'd like to join
the program very much![BRK]

Where do i sign up?[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, puhlease![BRK]

Just...forget it!
[END]

=== 3 | b9f2 | 120 ===
Sorry, the gondola's closed
to everyone 'cept dragon
kids right now.[BRK]

If i took you down to the
bottom and you escaped,
nall'd have my head.[BRK]

He just promoted me from
garbage duty, and i ain't
goin' back![BRK]

No way i'm riskin' my butt
for you guys![BRK]

If you want out, ask nall
yourself![BRK]

[POR02]
Wimp.[END]

=== 4 | bb2a | d4 ===
Excuse me, but are you
developmentally disabled?[BRK]

[POR02]
Why, are you looking for
a date?[BRK]

[POR00]
Enough lip from the freak
show.[BRK]

Nall gave orders to keep
you here. I ain't goin'
against them![BRK]

This gondola's goin'
nowhere![END]

=== 5 | bc0e | 10e ===
Oh, it's you again. Why do
you keep bothering me?[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, i don't know...maybe
because you know how to
operate the gondola?[BRK]

Stop me if i'm going too
fast for you...[BRK]

[POR00]
Yeah, yeah, yeah...so is 
that what you want, a ride?
[0x5]Hey! You read my mind!
No, we were just funnin'![END]

=== 6 | bd2c | 31 ===
Okay, okay...get on. I guess
i can take you down.[END]

=== 7 | bd78 | f0 ===
Hey! What do you think i am,
some sort of weird toy for
your own amusement?[BRK]

I don't think these little
games are funny![BRK]

[POR02]
Probably has something to do
with the lobotomy they gave
you at birth.[BRK]

I've heard that takes the
joy out of things...[END]

=== 8 | be7c | 65 ===
Nall told me not to let you
escape. Never, never, never,
n-e-v-e-r![BRK]

I don't plan on letting him
down.[END]

=== 9 | bef4 | 5e ===
Are you leaving? That's so
sad! I was just getting to
like you guys![BRK]

Come back and visit, huh?[END]

=== a | bf66 | 61 ===
Please don't try to escape
through my post![BRK]

If you succeed, nall will
yell at me and make me cry![END]

=== b | bfda | 66 ===
I just hate good-byes! I
always cry![BRK]

Just say you'll come
back soon and go silently...[BRK]

........please?[END]

=== c | c054 | 78 ===
Don't even think of trying
to escape on my watch![BRK]

I'll tie your underwear in
a knot so tight, it'll cut
you like cheese![END]

=== d | c0e0 | 4f ===
We may look like kids, but
don't underestimate our
strength![BRK]

We're bad muthas!
[END]

=== e | c14c | 81 ===
I'm w-warning you! Keep
back! If you try to escape,
i'll h-have to...[BRK]

[POR02]
Hey, hiro! This kid's scared
to death of us! Hahahaha!

[END]

=== f | c1d0 | 3c ===
I-i'm warning you! I know
h-how to use d-d-deadly
force!



[END]

=== 10 | c228 | 22a ===
[POR11]
I'm very impressed! You
rescued all the kidnapped
dragon kids![BRK]

To tell you the truth, I
thought they were all
goners![BRK]

[POR02]
Eh, it was nothing. Hiro's
a master of strategy, and
we have a great team![BRK]

[POR11]
Do you think this kind of
adventuring is appropriate
for a red dragon?[BRK]

[POR02]
Red dragon? But...i didn't
say anything about being a
red dragon.[BRK]

[POR11]
You didn't have to. Believe
me, i can tell.[BRK]

[POR02]
How! How can you tell?!!
And what do you mean 'not
appropriate?'[BRK]

Tell me this instant![BRK]

[POR11]
I think you all had better
come inside. I've got
something to tell you.
[END]

Taben's peak 7fe[END]

=== 12 | cf02 | 22b ===
[POR11]
Hey, everybody, look! Hiro
and his party are back!
How 'bout some applause?[BRK]

[POR00]
We don't know how to thank
you enough for rescuing our
friends![BRK]

You must be very powerful to
have defeated the blue
dragon cult![BRK]

I'd like to hear the story
of how you did it! Will you
tell it?[BRK]

[POR11]
Okay, okay...that's enough!
I'm sure they don't want to
tell bedtime stories![BRK]

You've expressed your
thanks, so leave the good
people alone now.[BRK]

...hiro, you said you wanted
to know where lucia was...[BRK]

I saw her around here a
while ago. If you look hard,
you should find her...

[END]

=== 13 | d15a | 127 ===
[POR05]
Hey, chief, you found lucia!
...say, why do both of you
look like you're blushing?[BRK]

[POR08]
Blushing...??[BRK]

[POR10]
It means your face is red
and hot because you're
embarrassed...[BRK]

[POR07]
I bet hiro was putting the
mega-moves on her...right,
lucia?[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

......this 'blushing' is
quite uncomfortable...[END]

=== 14 | d298 | 34 ===
[POR11]
Lucia's around here some-
where...try upstairs...[END]

=== 15 | d2e0 | 7a ===
[POR11]
Since you helped us get the
kidnapped kids back from the
blue dragon cult,[BRK]

i swear i will find a way to
pay you back...[END]

=== 16 | d36e | b1 ===
[POR11]
Why are you hanging around
here? Don't you have more
important things to do?[BRK]

I mean, i know my hideout is
cool, but you'd better hit
the road.[BRK]

[POR02]
We're going...we're going...[END]

=== 17 | d436 | d4 ===
[POR05]
Hey there, chief. Have you
found lucia yet? I heard
she's looking for you...[BRK]

[POR02]
We haven't seen her yet.
Do you know where she is?[BRK]

[POR05]
Not a clue, buckaroo. I just
know she's around here
somewhere. Go find her.[END]

=== 18 | d526 | 77 ===
[POR05]
What's the matter? Don't
you want to find lucia?[BRK]

She was asking for you, you
know. If i were you, i'd
go find her...[END]

=== 19 | d5b0 | b9 ===
[POR10]
Watching these kids play
reminds me of my childhood.[BRK]

But luckily, they'll never
have to endure the horror
of the blue dragon cult.[BRK]

That's a chapter of my life
i wish i could erase...[END]

=== 1a | d680 | b5 ===
[POR07]
Hey, kids, let's play 'pin
the cash on lemina', ok?[BRK]

It's really fun! You just
try to pin as much cash on
me as you can![BRK]

Go break your piggy banks,
i wanna get this game
started!
[END]

=== 1b | d750 | ca ===
[POR07]
Do any of you little squirts
want to be magicians when
you grow up?[BRK]

Well, study hard and maybe
you'll be strong enough to
enter the vane magic guild![BRK]

By the time you grow up,
it'll be fully restored![END]

=== 1c | d832 | 12 ===
[POR11]
Hey...wait up!
[END]

=== 1d | d848 | 93 ===
[POR11]
I heard that you were headed
to pentagulia to find
goddess althena.[BRK]

Before you left, i wanted to
give you something as thanks
for all your help.[END]

=== 1e | d8e7 | 167 ===
Received the white dragon
wings from nall.[BRK]

[0xB][0][0][POR11]
I think you'll find these
are a real kick![BRK]

They've lost a bit of power
in the last half-century,[BRK]

but they still can warp you
out of any dungeon back to
the ground level.[BRK]

They work pretty well most
of the time.  I hope they
serve you well![BRK]

The barricade on the road
to vane is now open. Good
luck on your quest![END]

=== 1f | da70 | 39 ===
Thank you for rescuing me
from the evil blue dragon
cult![END]

=== 20 | daac | 4c ===
Know what? Huh? Wanna know
what?[BRK]

When i grow up, i'm gonna
be just like you![END]

=== 21 | db0c | 47 ===
Please save the goddess from
the bad people that want to
revive zophar![END]

=== 22 | db64 | 93 ===
Didja ever wonder why trix
were for kids? I'm starting
to get the idea.[BRK]

I think it's because they're
too sugary for adults. They
can't handle it...[END]

=== 23 | dc06 | 154 ===
I knew you'd find a way
to save our world from
destruction.[BRK]

I definitely want to be like
you when i grow up...[BRK]

Well, that or a rock star. I
haven't really decided.[BRK]

And ya know, i really could
go for being a game
counselor.[BRK]

Or maybe even a movie star![BRK]

...come to think of it, I
don't want to be like you at
all.[BRK]

You suck.[BRK]

...booooooring!!


[END]

=== 24 | dd72 | 4b ===
I shudder to think what
would have happened to us
if you hadn't come along.[END]

=== 25 | ddd8 | 8e ===
If nall doesn't show his
full appreciation for what
you did for him,[BRK]

just chalk it up to him
being nall.[BRK]

He doesn't always show
what he feels.[END]

=== 26 | de7a | 92 ===
Nall isn't really good at
showing his feelings, but he
seems to care for you.[BRK]

In fact, i've caught him
wondering aloud what you
guys were up to...[END]

=== 27 | df20 | 7d ===
The goddess althena is fake?
This is amazing![BRK]

So, does that mean that she
was tied in with the blue
dragon cult somehow, too?[END]

=== 28 | dfb0 | 6f ===
The blue dragon cult has
disappeared?[BRK]

That's great news! At least
i can finally get a good
night's sleep again![END]

=== 29 | e030 | 53 ===
Nall's a little put-out
because you stole some of
his thunder...[BRK]

He'll get over it.[END]

=== 2a | e092 | 97 ===
I have to remain strong,
especially now that nall is
ready to move on...[BRK]

He told me that i should run
this place when he finally
became a white dragon.[END]

=== 2b | e146 | 94 ===
I always knew that someone
would rescue me from the
blue dragon cult.[BRK]

That's why i wasn't scared.
But i never guessed nall
wouldn't be with them...
[END]

=== 2c | e1de | ac ===
When i grow up, i want to
be nall's bride. Tee hee
hee.[BRK]

[POR02]
Um, i don't think you know
everything you need to about
your dreamcake...[BRK]

I'm certain he has some dark
secrets...[END]

=== 2d | e2b6 | 7c ===
I didn't know that nall was
really a white dragon! Can
humans and dragons marry?[BRK]

[POR02]
Only in special cases...
...right, hiro?[END]

=== 2e | e346 | d4 ===
Now that i know nall is a
white dragon, i'm so very
confused![BRK]

Should i still pursue him?[BRK]

[POR02]
It's probably better to just
admire him from afar.[BRK]

If you marry him, you'd just
be setting yourself up for
heartbreak...[END]

=== 2f | e42a | 11e ===
I've decided not to marry
nall. I think each should
marry their own kind.[BRK]

Besides, i don't want to be
an old bag when nall still
looks like a kid![BRK]

It'd look like a bad episode
of talk soup![BRK]

[POR02]
That's probably the right
decision.[BRK]

Besides, i think nall is
kinda sweet on me now! He
he he![END]

=== 30 | e55c | 1ad ===
The blue dragon cult has
kidnapped many of my
friends...[BRK]

[POR10]
The blue dragon cult is
evil. They teach innocent
children to be killers.[BRK]

Once trained in the ways of
black death karate, they 
can never leave the cult.[BRK]

I am the only one ever
trained that successfully
escaped.[BRK]

It's a chapter of my life
i'd just as soon forget...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

But enough about that...[BRK]

We've got to find a way to
rescue your friends before
it's too late![END]

=== 31 | e720 | 4b ===
A masked man kidnapped two
more of my friends! Please,
you have to help us![END]

=== 32 | e778 | 7b ===
Please, i'm begging you!
Help rescue my friends from
the blue dragon cult![BRK]

I'll...i'll give you all
the tinkertoys i have!
[END]

=== 33 | e806 | 38 ===
I don't know how to thank
you for saving all my
friends![END]

=== 34 | e84c | 46 ===
[POR10]
The best thanks you can give
me is to grow up to be a 
good person.[END]

=== 35 | e8a6 | 66 ===
I can't believe that the
goddess in pentagulia was a
fake![BRK]

I-i'm scared! What are you
gonna do now?!!
[END]

=== 36 | e924 | cc ===
If the goddess in pentagulia
is fake, what happened to
the real althena?[BRK]

I...i'm really getting
scared! Too much is going
on behind the scenes...[BRK]

I can't shake the feeling
that evil has spread
everywhere![END]

=== 37 | ea0c | 65 ===
Can you rescue the real
althena like you saved my
friends?[BRK]

Please? She must be out
there somewhere...[END]

=== 38 | ea80 | ba ===
Yeah!! Yeeeaahhh! Now that
the world is safe again, I
can play with no worries![BRK]

[POR02]
...except how you're going
to make a living with no
formal schooling...[BRK]

I hear mcborgan's is
hiring...
[END]

=== 39 | eb4e | 65 ===
How did the blue dragon cult
get in if we made another
barricade?[BRK]

They must have some strong
magic...[END]

=== 3a | ebca | 50 ===
If our barricades can't keep
the blue dragon cult out,
we're all in big trouble![END]

=== 3b | ec2e | 66 ===
Please stop the blue dragon
cult![BRK]

Once we're safe, we can take
down all the barricades we
had to make![END]

=== 3c | ecac | 6d ===
Now that everyone's been
rescued, we're getting ready
to take down the barricades.[BRK]

We should be done shortly.[END]

=== 3d | ed34 | 69 ===
If you just wait a little
longer, the barricades will
be cleared from the road.[BRK]

Then you can get to vane.[END]

=== 3e | edb0 | 68 ===
Now that the blue dragon
cult has been taken care of,
we took down the barricade.[BRK]

The road is now clear.[END]

=== 3f | ee2c | 9f ===
Is it true that the althena
cult is trying to revive an
evil spirit named zophar?[BRK]

If he's stronger than the
blue dragon cult, we're all
in a mess of trouble...[END]

=== 40 | eede | 75 ===
Of all the surprises! I had
no idea nall was the white
dragon![BRK]

I'll have to have a few
words with him when i see
him.[END]

=== 41 | ef62 | 86 ===
Hi, ruby! I'm glad you came
back to play again.
Everyone's waiting for you.[BRK]

[POR02]
Sorry i didn't come back to
play. Maybe next time...


[END]

=== 42 | eff8 | 38 ===
Oh no!...the blue dragon
cult?[BRK]

What are we going to do?
[END]

=== 43 | f048 | 84 ===
Look! Nall made a see-saw
board and a slide for us to
play on.[BRK]

But now that many of the
kids are missing, i don't
feel like playing.[END]

=== 44 | f0e8 | 49 ===
You have to find some way
to rescue my friends from
the blue dragon cult![END]

=== 45 | f144 | 3c ===
Everyone here is my best
friend. I'm so glad they
came back.[END]

=== 46 | f18e | 19 ===
[POR08]
Best friend? What...

[END]

=== 47 | f1ba | 9d ===
Hey, tell me, is this zophar
guy worse than the blue
dragon cult?[BRK]

If he is, does that mean
we're all in danger? I hope
not.[BRK]

I just got over the
nightmares...[END]

=== 48 | f26e | 72 ===
I can't believe that nall
was really the white dragon
all along![BRK]

That means he's the oldest
dude here, doesn't it?[END]

=== 49 | f2fc | 3d ===
Next time i see nall, i'm
gonna ask him how old he
really is![END]

=== 4a | f348 | a9 ===
Nall has been in this world
a long time, but he is not
an old man.[BRK]

I don't understand this
whole thing about dragon
aging...[BRK]

[POR02]
Maybe oil of olay is his
beauty secret...[END]

=== 4b | f400 | 51 ===
Ahhhhh! Naaaallll! Help me!
It's the blue dragon cult!
They've come for me! Ahhh![END]

=== 4c | f45e | 49 ===
[POR10]
Blue dragon cult?...us? I
think you're a very confused
little girl...
[END]

=== 4d | f4c4 | 63 ===
I'm sorry i mistook you for
the blue dragon cult members
a while ago.[BRK]

I'm just really jumpy
lately.[END]

=== 4e | f52a | 90 ===
Can you help get my friends
back?...please?[BRK]

I'll pay you with all the
barbie clothes i have![BRK]

I'll even throw in her
dream house and a ken
doll!
[END]

=== 4f | f5d2 | 31 ===
Haaa! Haa! Yeahhh! Come on
over and play with us![END]

=== 50 | f610 | 76 ===
[POR08]
I would like to learn how to
play, but i do not have the
time now.[BRK]

Maybe i'll come back later
and you can teach me.[END]

=== 51 | f69a | 7f ===
If the goddess is a fraud,
then the four heroes must
be in on it![BRK]

This plot must be huge!
We've got to find a way to
stop them![END]

=== 52 | f72c | 5c ===
Nall says that you have the
power to help stop the
althena cult, too.[BRK]

Are you going to help?[END]

=== 53 | f798 | dd ===
Where is lucia? She said
she'd come back so i could
teach her how to play.[BRK]

It's been so long, and she
hasn't come back. I don't
think she's coming...[BRK]

[POR02]
Don't worry, she's coming
back with hiro real soon!
......i promise![END]

=== 54 | f888 | 43 ===
I...i'm so scared! The blue
dragon cult is stealing all
my friends![END]

=== 55 | f8e2 | 4b ===
I'm even afraid to walk
outside now that the blue
dragon cult is so active![END]

=== 56 | f944 | 76 ===
Please, please, please! You
have to try to rescue my
friends...will you?
[0x5]Absolutely. No problem.
We'll certainly try.[END]

=== 57 | f9ca | 6c ===
Really? Oh, i was hoping
you'd say that![BRK]

You'd better hurry and get
started. No telling where
they're going![END]

=== 58 | fa4c | 40 ===
That's all i can ask you to
do...try. But please try
your best.
[END]

=== 59 | faa4 | 95 ===
We think of ourselves as one
big family. Please find the
kids that were stolen![BRK]

If they don't come back, it
will be terrible, just...
...terrible...

You're my second favorite
heroes in the whole world![BRK]

Nall's my favorite.[END]

=== 5b | fba8 | 60 ===
I heard that there are some
people from the stars on our
world.[BRK]

Do you think that could be
true?[END]

=== 5c | fc1c | 98 ===
Nall promised that at our
next story time he would
tell us about the old days.[BRK]

He said he'd tell us a story
about dragonmaster alex and
goddess althena.[END]

=== 5d | fcc4 | 72 ===
Nall said that he was the
closest friend to dragon-
master alex.[BRK]

I wonder what happened to
alex and the goddess...[END]

=== 5e | fd4a | 7b ===
I heard that the barricade
was removed, but i got lost
and ended up here.[BRK]

These crazy kids have built
some tree house, huh?[END]

=== 5f | fdd8 | bc ===
I was on my way from nota
to here and got lost.[BRK]

But the master of this
place asked me to stay and
open a snack concession.[BRK]

I think i can make a pretty
good buck sellin' junk to
these kids.[END]

=== 60 | fea4 | 2e ===
I hope the kids that went to
meribia are safe.[END]

=== 61 | feea | a8 ===
Please be careful if you go
to meribia.[BRK]

My friend went to look for
the ones that were kidnapped
and got lost in the sewers.[BRK]

If you go down there, you
should make a map.[END]

=== 62 | ffae | 4c ===
No one that went to meribia
came back. Are they lost...
...or kidnapped too?[END]

=== 63 | 10012 | 67 ===
I'm so glad everyone is now
safe and sound![BRK]

Oh, except gimpy john, but
he wasn't sound to begin
with...[END]

=== 64 | 10094 | 43 ===
I don't know how to thank
you guys properly. You've
done so much...[END]

=== 65 | 100ea | 6c ===
You guys knew that nall
knew the goddess personally,
right?[BRK]

For some reason, he wants
to keep that a secret.[END]

=== 66 | 1016e | 70 ===
I think it's funny that nall
is actually the white
dragon.[BRK]

I like to tease him by
calling him an old white
fart.[END]

=== 67 | 101fa | 68 ===
Nall may be the great white
dragon, but he's still just
nall to us.[BRK]

We know him too well to be
in awe...[END]

=== 68 | 10272 | 109 ===
Nall knows a lot about the
history of this world.[BRK]

He told me about an exciting
time with airships and
amazing battles![BRK]

In fact, he said that our
hideout is made from one
of the relics of that time.[BRK]

I wonder what he was talking
about...sometimes he's such
a tease...[END]

The time has come for the

again.[BRK]

We must use the power of the

That should free her from
confinement, and give us
access to the goddess tower.[BRK]

Will you help us, nall?[BRK]

I wish i could, but the

been sealed and locked away.[BRK]

I don't believe even zophar

you even claimed it![BRK]

[POR08]
And...if the dragon power
is sealed away, they cannot
help us![BRK]

[POR11]
Bingo.[BRK]

I suppose i have to stop
underestimating your
intelligence...[BRK]

But enough of that...[BRK]

I don't have the power to
counter ghaleon and return
the dragonpower...[BRK]

...but you do, lucia. With
your help, we might be able
to do it.[END]

=== c3 | 16822 | 12b ===
[POR11]
Listen, there is really only
one shot at saving the
goddess.[BRK]

First, you must find the
four dragon auras.[BRK]

They will not be easy to
recover, for each is guarded
by one of althena's heroes.[BRK]

Lucia will not be able to
accomplish the task by
herself.[BRK]

She must have help. What are
you going to do, hiro?[END]

=== c4 | 16950 | 38 ===
[0x5]I think i'll take a break.
Adventure is my middle name.[END]

=== c5 | 16998 | e4 ===
[POR01]
Lucia, i'd really like to
help you, but i'm kinda
lookin' for a break...[BRK]

[POR08]
Hiro...[BRK]

[POR11]
I knew you lacked the heart
of a true dragonmaster,
coward.[BRK]

Buddy, i knew alex, alex
was a friend of mine, and 
you, sir, are no alex!



[END]

=== c6 | 16a92 | 1fd ===
[POR01]
I will stand by lucia's side
and help her until her
mission is complete.[BRK]

That's my responsibility.
I will not back away from
it, despite the odds![BRK]

[POR08]
Oh, thank you, hiro![BRK]

Know that i appreciate your
actions more than words can
express.[BRK]

But this isn't going to be
an easy job. It could cost
us dearly.[BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro's up to it! He's the
best there is![BRK]

...and he's all mine![BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR02]
Come on, hiro, tell lucia
you're more interested in me
than her!![BRK]

[POR11]
Man, ruby, can't you see
what's really going on
here?[END]

=== c7 | 16caa | 66 ===
[POR11]
Lucia can't recover the
dragon auras alone. She
needs your help.[BRK]

Will you lend her your
assistance?[END]

=== c8 | 16d2c | a1 ===
[POR11]
Great! Now listen up! You 
must first defeat the person
who holds my aura...[BRK]

...white knight leo![BRK]

[POR02]
...what?...leo?[BRK]

But....i thought he was
on our side...


[END]

=== c9 | 16de8 | c9 ===
[POR11]
Don't underestimate the
strength of leo. He is a
skilled swordsman.[BRK]

And far too powerful for me
to fight in my present
condition.[BRK]

Please hurry and finish 
this task quickly. We don't
have much time![END]

=== ca | 16ed2 | 44 ===
[POR11]
Now, the next aura lies 
to the south of the white
dragon cavern.[END]

=== cb | 16f1a | 18e ===
[POR11]
I will wait for you here
until you have recovered
all of the dragons' power.[BRK]

[POR02]
Geez, what a lazy butt![BRK]

You have your power back.
Why don't you free the
dragons?[BRK]

[POR11]
You just don't understand
yet, do you ruby?[BRK]

Dragonpower cannot be used
against dragons.[BRK]

Since it is the source of
this world's power,[BRK]

if it was used against one
of the sources of that very
power,[BRK]

...the result would be
disastrous![END]

=== cc | 170c4 | 1a3 ===
[POR11]
Hiro, take good care of
our little red dragon.[BRK]

She just might be the trump
card we need to win this
war.[BRK]

[POR02]
But how can i help in this
battle? I'm not even full-
grown yet![BRK]

[POR11]
That's right...you are a bit
slow...[BRK]

Too bad you're not as quick
as i was in picking all
this up.[BRK]

[POR02]
Hey! I heard that you didn't
find out about your heritage
'til you were older than me![BRK]

[POR11]
Hehe...uh, you heard about
that, huh?[BRK]

...whoops!
[END]

=== cd | 1727e | ef ===
[POR11]
Great! You've recovered the
black dragon's aura![BRK]

Now, ruby, it's time for you
to release your aura.[BRK]

[POR02]
I know, nall...but i don't
think i'm ready for the
responsibility.[BRK]

I know if i don't do this,
all is lost,[BRK]

but...
i...[BRK]

[POR11]
Ruby...?


[END]

=== ce | 17388 | b7 ===
[POR11]
Ruby, accepting your 
birthright is the only
way to stop zophar.[BRK]

If you don't become an adult
red dragon, then zophar has
already won![BRK]

[POR02]
I don't know nall...
i...i'm just scared!
[END]

=== cf | 17452 | e9 ===
[POR11]
Ruby, you're our last hope.
You'll be the deciding
factor in our struggle![BRK]

What's it gonna be?[BRK]

[POR02]
You're right, nall. I'm
ready.[BRK]

[POR11]
Great! Then get a move on!
You've wasted enough time
listening to me.[BRK]

You must release your aura!
[END]

=== d0 | 1754e | 95 ===
[POR11]
What!?
Damn that ghaleon![BRK]

Lucia, you must rescue hiro!
Only by joining forces can
zophar be defeated![BRK]

[POR02]
You heard him, lucia! Let's
rescue hiro!
[END]

=== d1 | 175f6 | 1c3 ===
[POR11]
Hey, guys, great to see ya!
How's everything going?[BRK]

Say what's wrong with hiro?
He seems kinda bummed...[BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro's down because lucia
went back to the blue star![BRK]

[POR11]
So what are you gonna do
about it, hiro?[BRK]

Hmmm...[BRK]

That's a gutsy move. Gonna
attempt to go to the blue
star, eh?[BRK]

Since i'm such a great guy,
tell ya what i'm gonna do.[BRK]

I'll give you this sword
to aid you in your quest.[BRK]

Use it well.[BRK]

[POR00]
[0xB][0]Lhiro received the legendary
sword of althena!
[END]

=== d2 | 177c2 | 102 ===
[POR11]
Hiro, you're the only one
i trust with this sword.[BRK]

It belonged to the last
true dragonmaster, and
my best friend, alex.[BRK]

[POR01]
....
.....[BRK]

I don't know what to
say, nall.[BRK]

[POR11]
Just promise me you'll
use it as he would have.[BRK]

[POR01]
You have my word. Thank
you, nall.
[END]

=== d3 | 178f4 | d8 ===
[POR11]
In order to get to the blue
star, you're going to have
to outsmart the star dragon![BRK]

He guards the way to the
crystal that connects
lunar to the blue star.[BRK]

I sincerely hope you're
strong enough, hiro.[BRK]

Good luck!


[END]

=== d4 | 179e8 | 1cc ===
[POR11]
Hiro! Lucia is waiting!
Why are you still here?[BRK]

...
....[BRK]

Oh yeah...since you came
back, there's just one
more thing...[BRK]

You'll need two dragon eye
jewels to get into the star
tower.[BRK]

You can probably find one in
the ice tower near my cave, 
to the west.[BRK]

I'll make the tower visible
to you.[BRK]

Hey, and while you're gone,
why not leave ruby here?[BRK]

I'll take good care of her
for you. We had a blast last
time...[BRK]

[POR02]
Sheah, right! Remember, bud,
i have pepper spray![END]

=== d5 | 17bd0 | 109 ===
[POR11]
You're still a brat, aren't
you, ruby?[BRK]

But i kinda like the fiery
type.[BRK]

[POR01]
Oh man! You two are made
for each other! Sheesh![BRK]

[POR11]
Ya think? Hehe...[BRK]

[POR02]
Hey! This is our problem,
hiro. So stay out of it![BRK]

[POR01]
Oh, um...sorry, ruby.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

But you are cute together!

Taben's peak!

See i told you those white
dragon wings would come in
handy![BRK]

I would've liked to have
seen just how much of that
'goddess' was fake...[BRK]

Fake chicks gross me out!
[END]

=== d9 | 17e08 | ee ===
[POR05]
Hey, you two can count me
in on this adventure![BRK]

I can't let althena's cult
continue to brainwash those
poor people![BRK]

Besides, i just might be
able to rescue mauri.[BRK]

I know a good bet when I
see one, and i'm gonna bet
we kick their butts.[END]

=== da | 17f1e | 100 ===
...report! Report!![BRK]

Hey, we're the lookout team.[BRK]

Watch your backs. We just 
heard that the destiny is
coming this way.[BRK]

Be careful![BRK]

[POR11]
Great work, men! Hiro, it's
up to you to recover the
dragon aura from leo.[BRK]

I'll wait for you in the
white dragon cave.



[END]

=== db | 18022 | c9 ===
[POR02]
I don't think we need to
fight leo since he helped
us in pentagulia.[BRK]

He should be willing to 
give us the white dragon
aura.[BRK]

He's already our friend.
This oughtta be a piece
of cake. Let's go, hiro![END]

=== dc | 18102 | 76 ===

I thought my journey would
end at pentagulia.[BRK]

But now i'm beginning to
get the feeling it's going
to go on forever![END]

Lucia's going to take on

Count me in! I want to even
the score for what those 
creeps did to me.[END]

be getting bigger, doesn't
it hiro?[END]

Count me in on this battle![BRK]

I've got a mega-grudge to
settle with that fat turd
borgan,[BRK]

and i have a feeling this
battle will allow me to do
just that![BRK]

Besides, a good premier
would never pass up an
opportunity like this![END]

We'd better be mega-careful
around here. Taben's peak is
just ahead.[BRK]

Statistically, this is where
most of the robberies take
place.[BRK]

Keep your eyes peeled and
your hands on your
valuables.[BRK]

[POR02]
Ronfar! Get your hands out
of your pants![BRK]

Oh yeah?! Just try it, you
rude freak of nature![BRK]

[POR11]
Rude...freak...of???[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Listen here! You are
trespassers on my property,
not the other way around.[BRK]

If i were in your shoes, i'd
tread lightly![BRK]

Anyway, you seem harmless
enough, and i don't have 
time to fool with you.[BRK]

So i'd recommend that you
turn right around and leave
while you can![BRK]

Continue at your own risk![END]

That boy is nothing but a
rude pain in the butt![BRK]

I wonder if he's a member of
the blue dragon cult![BRK]

[POR10]
Hmm...i don't think so...i
don't remember ever seeing
him...[BRK]

[POR08]
No...no...his aura is not
one of evil...he's something
like a....[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh...sure! Gang up on me
and tell me what a nice guy
he is![BRK]

I'm not changing my mind!
That kid's nothing but a
punk![BRK]

Where's dirty harry when you
need him?![BRK]

[POR07]
Hey, hey...hey! Look! Over
there! That looks like some
sort of elevator![BRK]

Maybe it can take us over
taben's peak to vane! We're
so close![BRK]

I'm sure we can make it![BRK]

[POR02]
But...the boy said to turn
around![BRK]

Is there a way to get there
without going through the
forest?[BRK]

I've really had my share of
confrontation for the
week...[END]

Hey! What in the world is

should be clear![BRK]

I'll bet those bandits did
this![BRK]

Pooh! This was the path to
vane, too! Maybe we can find
some other way...[END]

Hey! What are you doing
here? That gondola is off-

And don't even think about
using this ladder![BRK]

I'm not s'posed to let
anyone past...[END]

you want another ride up?

Now, i want to warn you that
the city might look a little
run-down at first glance,[BRK]

but once we get the guild
back up and running,[BRK]

the town will be ship-shape
in no time! All it takes is
a little elbow grease.[BRK]

How much are you planning on
draining us for?[BRK]
