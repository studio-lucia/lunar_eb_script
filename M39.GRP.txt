Man! This town is nothing
but locked tower doors![BRK]

Forget it, Hiro. This door
ain't budging.[END]

Ah! It's been some time
since our last encounter,
Jean.[BRK]

What brings you all the
way to Pentagulia?[BRK]

[POR00]
[0xB][0][0x3][ROR10]
...It's this mask. I took
it from the leader of the
Blue Dragon Cult.[BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR16]
But...what good is this
mask? Didn't you get a
look at the leader?[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR10]
No, he covered his face
before I could get a look
at it.[BRK]

He was in such a hurry to
get away, though, that
he dropped the mask.[BRK]

His voice seemed so very
familiar...but I can't
put my finger on it...[END]

Master Lunn is a very
busy man.[BRK]

No one ever gets to spend
more than five minutes
talking to him.[BRK]

It's such a shame! That
poor man never gets any
rest...[END]

=== 3 | 18296 | b0 ===
With all the traveling that
Lunn does,[BRK]

he's earned enough frequent
sailing miles to the travel
world over...[BRK]

...ten times![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I wonder if he'll let me
use them...???[END]

=== 4 | 18356 | df ===
Lunn uses us merely as
sparring partners while
he's here in Pentagulia.[BRK]

Just between you and me...[BRK]

I'm tired of being a
punching bag...[BRK]

If this is what I've got
to do to be a member of
Lunn's karate team,[BRK]

...I'm gonna quit![END]

=== 5 | 18448 | 88 ===
I'm beginning to think that
Lunn likes beating up poor,
weak slobs like myself...[BRK]

...he gets some kind of
perverse pleasure out of
it...[END]

=== 6 | 184e0 | c3 ===
Years ago, Lunn was trying
to develop a new type of
martial art...[BRK]

Yet he lost interest once
he became one of the Four
Heroes...[BRK]

I wonder what kind of 
fighting technique he was
going to invent?[END]

=== 7 | 185b6 | a6 ===
Lunn says that to be truly
effective during combat,[BRK]

one must know everything
about their enemy.[BRK]

If you learn your enemy's
weaknesses, you can attack
them mercilessly.[END]

=== 8 | 1866c | 8b ===
Many of the priests say
they're interested in
Master Lunn's honesty.[BRK]

I think they're interested
in the taxes he collects for
the Goddess...[END]

=== 9 | 1870a | 30 ===
Lunn sure has an impressive
physique up close...[END]

[POR09]
I've been following your
progress. Good work![BRK]

Don't worry, I won't tell
anyone that you've escaped.[BRK]

In fact, I believe we must
work together to discover
what's going on here.[BRK]

I believe that an evil
lurks within Althena's
organization,[BRK]

and I must find it![BRK]

Our first order of business
must be to find Lucia and
hear her story.[BRK]

I believe that she is being
held within a secret area
of the shrine.[BRK]

The entrance can be found
in a chamber in these under-
ground passages.[BRK]

Let's go.[BRK]

[POR05]
....
.....[BRK]

Leo, these costume changes
are getting kind of old.[BRK]

Are you going to be Leo
for a while, now?[BRK]

[POR09]
What have you been sniffin',
Ronfar?[BRK]

There's never been any
disguises...[BRK]

...But regardless, we must
get to the shrine.[BRK]

Lucia's life hangs in the
balance![END]

[POR10]
Thank goodness![BRK]

I've been counting the
minutes since they locked
me in that cell![BRK]

I was hoping you were all
okay![BRK]

Say, what's Leo doing with
you?[BRK]

Isn't he working for the
Goddess?[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, well, yes and no.[BRK]

Near as we can tell, this
is some sort of party game
Leo's playing.[BRK]

He's dressed up and calls
himself 'Mystere.'[BRK]

He's the one that rescued
Hiro and me from the cell
first![BRK]

[POR10]
All right, then, Mystere it
is![BRK]

Listen, some really bad
stuff is going on here.[BRK]

When I went to see Master
Lunn to report on the Blue
Dragon Cult,[BRK]

I discovered something very
interesting...[END]

[POR16]
Ah! It's been some time
since our last encounter,
Jean.[BRK]

What brings you all the
way to Pentagulia?[BRK]

[POR00]
[0xB][0][0x3][ROR10]
...It's this mask. I took
it from the leader of the
Blue Dragon Cult.[BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR16]
But...what good is this
mask? Didn't you get a
look at the leader?[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR10]
No, he covered his face
before I could get a look
at it.[BRK]

He was in such a hurry to
get away, though, that
he dropped the mask.[BRK]

His voice seemed so very
familiar...but I can't
put my finger on it...[BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR16]
Ha, ha, ha...Jean, you
always were my best student.[BRK]

But you never knew when to
give up...to leave well
enough alone...[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR10]
...Your best student? What
...are you talking ab....[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...it was you! You are the
leader of the Cult![BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR16]
I'm surprised it took you
so long to put it together.[BRK]

But then again, you were 
bred to fight, not to think.[BRK]

...And fight you did![BRK]

Under my watchful eye, your
fighting skill increased
a hundred-fold![BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR10]
Yes, but you forced me to
use that skill for death and
destruction.[BRK]

I was nothing more than an
assassin for your corrupt
cause![BRK]

You stole my childhood,
Lunn.[BRK]

I'll never forgive you
for that![BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR16]
'Never' is such a strong
word.[BRK]

Think about it, Jean! I
molded you into what you
are today![BRK]

You should thank me.[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR10]
You molded me into what?[BRK]

An emotional wreck who is
always running from a past
I don't understand?[BRK]

...Or maybe a trained
killer who can never live
a normal life?[BRK]

You took everything I had,
and gave me nothing in
return.[BRK]

You never cared about me.[BRK]

I was simply another child
whose soul you would blacken
for your own evil purpose.[BRK]

A trusting child whose
innocence you would tear
away with no remorse.[BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR16]
Jean...Jean...You make it
sound so...harsh.[BRK]

I did care about you. Your
skill was beyond anything I
had encountered.[BRK]

...You were special.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

We could have gone far
together.[BRK]

But your rebellion has made
us adversaries.[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR10]
I will always be the
adversary of evil.[BRK]

You must be stopped.[BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR16]
Well then, Jean. The time
has come for your final
lesson.[BRK]

And a hard lesson it will
be...[END]

=== 12 | 1c010 | 63 ===
[ROR10]
...I don't believe...[BRK]

...Your karate has...grown
...so....strong...[BRK]

Lunn...you...you...can't...[END]

=== 13 | 1c082 | e4 ===
[POR10]
...And the next thing I
knew, I was in this cell.[BRK]

We have to find a way to
stop Lunn![BRK]

He can't be allowed to
continue stealing the
innocence of children.[BRK]

His newer, stronger Black
Karate of Death cannot be
allowed to spread.[END]

=== 14 | 1c17e | 85 ===
[POR13]
Okay, now that the tearful
reunion is finished, I've
finished my task.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Your next step is entirely
up to you. Good luck![END]

=== 15 | 1c20c | 1b2 ===
[POR02]
I don't know what we would
have done if Leo...uh...
Mystere hadn't come.[BRK]

I'm certain he saved our
lives.[BRK]

I just think it's funny
that he thinks he's fooling
us with that mask.[BRK]

[POR05]
If members of Althena's 
cult knew that he was 
helping us...[BRK]

They would not only kill
him, but Mauri as well.[BRK]

I think he realized that
this was the only way
he could help us.[BRK]

He has a good heart. I
just hope he leaves the Cult
before it's too late...[END]
