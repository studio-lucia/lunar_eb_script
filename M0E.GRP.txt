Oh no! Lucia is...[BRK]

[POR05]
Leo is trained in the ways
of Althena's Guard.[BRK]

If we don't get Lucia back
right now, there's no
telling what could happen.[BRK]

...except that it won't be
good for Lucia's health.[BRK]

So, chief, the gameplan's to
sneak onto the Destiny and
rescue her, right?





[END]

=== 1 | 6c8a | 68 ===
[POR02]
...what?!
Hiro, the statue of Goddess
Althena is broken!![BRK]

Now how are we going to
restore our health?[END]

=== 2 | 6d0a | 86 ===
[POR02]
What is this world coming to
when holy statues are
defaced like this?!![BRK]

Punk kids...they don't know
the meaning of respect
anymore.[END]

=== 3 | 6da0 | 4f ===
Welcome to Dalton![BRK]

Ships from all over the
world come to this very
famous port.[END]

=== 4 | 6e02 | 69 ===
Welcome to the famous port
town of Dalton![BRK]

Are you just travelers, or
are you members of Althena's
Guard?[END]

=== 5 | 6e7e | 44 ===
Dalton is the largest port
bordering on the Salyan
Desert, you know.[END]

=== 6 | 6ed2 | 4f ===
Welcome to the port of
Dalton![BRK]

Now that the world is safe,
we're partying down![END]

=== 7 | 6f30 | ae ===
I can't imagine what kind
of deviant would have the
gall to do this![BRK]

Now how will weary travelers
refresh their spirits?
[0x5]I was just wondering that.
Who gives a rip? I don't.[END]

=== 8 | 6fee | 7e ===
Well, there is a statue just
like it in the shrine of the
Althena Cult.[BRK]

It's kinda weird in there,
but their statue does work.[END]

=== 9 | 707e | 91 ===
This is exactly the kind of
apathetic reaction that I'm
talking about![BRK]

Is nothing sacred to you
anymore? Does your life have
no meaning?[BRK]

Heretic![END]

=== a | 7122 | ae ===
The Cult of Althena has said
they will fix the statue,
free of charge.[BRK]

I think they're a little
extreme, but I appreciate
their offer.[BRK]

I think I'll let them do
the work, too.[END]

=== b | 71e8 | 51 ===
Althena must be pleased. I
know I'm just tickled pink
now that everything's okay![END]

=== c | 724c | 95 ===
Northeast of here, there's 
somethin' they call the
ninth wonder of the world.[BRK]

It's some sorta dragon tower
thingamabob. They say it's
mighty keen...[END]

=== d | 72f4 | eb ===
There's a weird tower north-
east of here named after
some Star Dragon.[BRK]

Place is s'posed to be full
of mysterious stuff no one
ain't seen in a century![BRK]

Coupla young whippersnappers
like you could have a field-
day explorin' that place.[END]

=== e | 73f2 | c5 ===
Say, kiddies, didn't ya get
my hint about the Star
Tower?[BRK]

It's loaded with all sorts
uh weird monsters an' great
treasure.[BRK]

[POR02]
Hiro, I bet that's the tower
Grandpa was talking about!
Let's go!





[END]

=== f | 74ca | 81 ===
There's s'posed to be some
fancy-schmancy Star Tower
northeast of here.[BRK]

I done never been there, but
I heard it's mighty unusual.[END]

=== 10 | 755e | 6a ===
Hey!...hey! Do ya know
the names of the Four
Heroes of Althena?
[0x5]Yep! Saw the movie.
No, tell me about it![END]

=== 11 | 75d8 | 22 ===
Movie? Say, mister, what's
that?

[END]

=== 12 | 760c | 3d ===
Oh, goodie! I hoped you'd
say that! I love reciting
them!



[END]

=== 13 | 764c | 155 ===
The first of the four heroes
is White Knight Leo, lord
of Althena's Guard.[BRK]

Second is Saint Lunn, master
of Blue Dragon Karate.[BRK]

Third is Grand Black Wizard
Borgan.[BRK]

And last is...is...hmm...[BRK]

...oh yeah! The last hero is
Red Priest Mauri.[BRK]

I learned all about them at
the school of the Althena
Cult.[BRK]

Memorized them myself.
Aren'cha proud of me?
[END]

=== 14 | 77b8 | 75 ===
Hey there. Have you heard
the names of the Four
Heroes of Althena?
[0x5]You told me, ya dumb kid!
Uh, I don't remember...[END]

=== 15 | 783c | 8b ===
Oh...yeah, I told you about
them already, didn't i? I
spaced and forgot...[BRK]

You probably think I'm the
world's youngest alzheimer's
patient.[END]

=== 16 | 78d8 | 59 ===
Wait a minute...you look
very familiar. Hey! I
already told you this![BRK]

Oh well, listen up![END]

=== 17 | 7948 | 1fe ===
My daddy said that he heard
the Four Heroes of Althena
don't control the dragons.[BRK]

He said they lost control
when the dragons were
released.[BRK]

I wish I could see one of
the dragons. They must be
awesome![BRK]

[POR02]
Well, kiddo, this is your
lucky day! Feast your eyes
on me![BRK]

[POR00]
Is this some kind of a sick
joke? You're not one of the
Four Dragons![BRK]

You're just some stinkin'...
stinkin'...well, I don't
know what you are...[BRK]

But you're too small to be
a dragon.[BRK]

[POR02]
Well, I'm big enough to
toast your impudent butt,
junior!
[END]

=== 18 | 7b5e | 99 ===
It would be so cool if I
got to see one of the Four
Dragons![BRK]

My dad would never believe
me, though.[BRK]

'Specially if I told him I
saw it on mulberry street.[END]

=== 19 | 7c0e | 95 ===
[POR05]
When we leave Dalton, we'd
better head north, toward
Illusion Woods.[BRK]

After we clear the woods, we
can make tracks for the holy
city of Pentagulia.[END]

=== 1a | 7cb2 | c6 ===
One of the Four Heroes of
Althena is White Knight Leo.[BRK]

Have you seen him? He's just
so cute. I could eat him
alive![BRK]

Ooh! And that horn! Oh baby,
I bet he knows exactly how
to use that monster! Whoo![END]

=== 1b | 7d8c | 87 ===
Lord Leo was just here! Did
you get to see him?[BRK]

He had on the complete hunk
duds. Tight white pants and
a cool red cape.[BRK]

I'm in heaven![END]

=== 1c | 7e26 | 6f ===
Lord Leo left way too soon
for my taste. He had to go
fight monsters or something.[BRK]

I hope he comes back soon...[END]

=== 1d | 7ea8 | 78 ===
There's a rumor floating
around that Lord Leo's been
thrown out of the guard![BRK]

How can that be?[BRK]

Do you know if it's true?[END]

=== 1e | 7f30 | b0 ===
When Leo found out that the
Althena Cult was trying to
revive Zophar, he left.[BRK]

Good looks and principled,
too! Is this guy too good to
be true or what?!![BRK]

Come to mama, big boy![END]

=== 1f | 7fee | e2 ===
[POR09]
While I'd like to honor your
request, I'm afraid you may
not let me go.[BRK]

So, I must respectfully deny
your request and just blow
you a kiss from here.[BRK]

Be sure to catch my 'lords
of valor' beefcake calendar
when it comes out.[END]

=== 20 | 80e0 | b2 ===
Have you heard of the Cult
of Althena? They have a
shrine up there.[BRK]

They're saying that the
Goddess has come back to
save the world.[BRK]

But I really don't see how
that can be true.
[END]

=== 21 | 81a6 | b1 ===
Did you see how immense the
Dragonship Destiny was?![BRK]

The power of Althena is
truly a wonderful thing,[BRK]

but I don't know about her
followers. They're a little
weird for my taste.
[END]

=== 22 | 826a | af ===
The members of Althena's
Cult keep inviting me to go
to their shrine.[BRK]

I've been turning them down,
but maybe now it wouldn't be
a bad idea.[BRK]

I could pray to Althena for
help...[END]

=== 23 | 8328 | 7e ===
You know what those cult
members were doing?[BRK]

Those evil little weasels
were praying for the return
of Zophar![BRK]

Isn't that sick?[END]

=== 24 | 83b6 | 95 ===
When I grow up, I want to
be a strong man that can
protect our world.[BRK]

I really look up to the Four
Heroes of Althena. They're
sorta my role models...[END]

=== 25 | 845e | 79 ===
When I grow up, I want to
be a member of Althena's
Guard.[BRK]

Lord Leo is so cool! He must
be the greatest guy to work
under![END]

=== 26 | 84ea | cf ===
Lately, I've been having
nightmares where numbers
keep attacking me.[BRK]

I keep seeing the number
52,766...and it scares me.
What does it mean?[BRK]

Please, ya gotta tell me!
I'm afraid to even shut my
eyes at night![END]

=== 27 | 85c8 | 89 ===
I heard that because people
all worked together, our
world was saved.[BRK]

When I grow up, I want to
be able to save the world
from evil, too![END]

=== 28 | 8660 | 66 ===
Work, eat, sleep. Work, eat
sleep. That's all I ever
seem to do anymore.[BRK]

I tell ya, it's a dog's
life![END]

=== 29 | 86da | 86 ===
I heard Lord Leo captured a
destroyer! Can you believe
that?[BRK]

A destroyer, right here in
our little town! What is
this world comin' to?[END]

=== 2a | 8774 | 117 ===
I tell ya, those cult
members are really gettin'
on my nerves.[BRK]

Yesterday, they had the gall
to ask me if I'd donate my
paycheck to Althena![BRK]

Can you believe that? I
mean, a donation's one
thing, but my whole check?!![BRK]

Those little weasels are
gettin' too greedy for their
own good.[END]

=== 2b | 889a | 85 ===
I tell ya. Each day that
goes by,[BRK]

I'm doubtin' more that
Althena is supportin' the
Cult.[BRK]

I think it's just a big scam
to get money...[END]

=== 2c | 8924 | 6 ===
Dalton[END]

=== 2d | 9dca | 7f ===
Halt! You have no business
aboard the dragon steam-
ship Destiny![BRK]

You'd better leave before
Lord Leo returns from
Gwyn's house![END]

=== 2e | 9e56 | 49 ===
[POR02]
Hiro? What is Lord Leo
doing at Grandpa's house?
We'd better find out![END]

=== 2f | 9eb2 | 8e ===
This is the Dragonship
Destiny, pride of the
entire Althena guard![BRK]

What? Lord Leo? He's
retired to his quarters.
You'd better not bother him.
[END]

=== 30 | 9f4e | 43 ===
[POR04]
But I must tell him of
the events at the Blue
Tower! Let us in!
[END]

=== 31 | 9fa0 | 3b ===
This area is off-limits
without the permission
of Lord Leo.[END]

=== 32 | 9fea | 67 ===
Halt! Who goes there?![BRK]

Freakin' thrill-seekers!
If ya don't vacate the ship
right now, I'll haul ya in![END]

=== 33 | a060 | 82 ===
The Dragonship Destiny was
given to Lord Leo by the
Goddess Althena.[BRK]

It is equipped with a mighty
White Dragon cannon at its
bow.
[END]

=== 34 | a0f2 | 8f ===
We are retained by the
Goddess Althena herself to
keep our world from harm.[BRK]

This ship draws on her
power, and Lord Leo
answers directly to her.[END]

=== 35 | a190 | b9 ===
The Goddess Althena is
fairest of the fair.[BRK]

I saw her once, and I'll
never forget it...[BRK]

That milky skin, the curve
of her hips,...those smooth,
supple br...[BRK]

.............uh, never mind![END]

=== 36 | a270 | 7d ===
[POR09]
Ha ha ha ha!
Is that everything you've
got, my boy?[BRK]

With such paltry skill,
you don't stand a chance
of changing anything![END]

=== 37 | a2fa | c0 ===
[POR09]
Hiro, your skill is without
equal. Perhaps you are the
one of legend.[BRK]

Please take this. It holds
the power of the White
Dragon within it.[BRK]

[POR00]
[0xB][0][0x4]Received the White Dragon
Aura from Lord Leo.[END]

=== 38 | a3c4 | d3 ===
[POR09]
The White Dragon sleeps
within the iceberg of the
North Sea.[BRK]

Take my ship. It will get
you there swiftly. You've
no time to waste![BRK]

Take to the seas outside
Meribia and use the helm
of the Destiny to navigate.[END]

=== 39 | a4a0 | 10b ===
[POR09]
The time has come for me
to relinquish command of
the Destiny.[BRK]

Take the helm, Hiro. You are
now the Destiny's captain.[BRK]

I cannot remain with you to
fight, so it is here that
we must part ways.[BRK]

[POR01]
But...Leo.[BRK]

[POR09]
Fight bravely, fight well,
and most of all fight fair.
[END]

=== 3a | a5ca | 67 ===
[POR09]
Come on, lad! I know you
can do better than that![BRK]

I'll give you another shot.
Concentrate this time![END]

[POR01]
....
.....[END]

=== 3c | a674 | 7b ===
[POR02]
Hey! Hey, Hiro! Let's get
this ship moving![BRK]

Didn't Leo say that we
could move the ship from
the helm?[BRK]

Hop to it, buster![END]

=== 3d | a706 | 18a ===
[POR02]
Hiro! Lucia! Look! It's the
port of Pentagulia![BRK]

[POR08]
I'm certain that Althena's
impostor has closed the
transmission spring by now.[BRK]

So the only way to get back
to Althena's tower will be
to break zopahr's seal.[BRK]

Once we arrive, I can try to
use dragonpower to break it.[BRK]

Hopefully there will be
enough power...and then...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Oh, Althena must trust me,
even if the result is...[BRK]

[POR01]
.....?
[END]

=== 3e | a89a | 1f0 ===
[ROR08]
I know your plan, Ghaleon.[BRK]

You have joined with zopahr
to destroy this world![BRK]

[ROR14]
Me? Destroy the world?
Oh dear, that sounds so,
so...barbaric.[BRK]

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmm...[BRK]

I love it.[BRK]

But don't confuse my
intentions, sweet child.[BRK]

I fully intend to recreate
the world with Zophar once
the impurities are removed.[BRK]

And I've decided to start
my impurity abatement 
program with you, Lucia.[BRK]

Wave bye-bye to your little
boyfriend, dear.[BRK]

I sense a coming...chill
in your relationship...[BRK]

Ha ha ha ha ha!



[END]

=== 3f | aa94 | 2f3 ===
[ROR14]
Hrmph! What a seriously
confused little boy.[BRK]

If he had minded his own
business, he'd still be
alive.[BRK]

But now that he's out of
the way, Lucia is all mine![BRK]

[ROR08]
Hiro!?...Hiro!!!
Nooooooo![BRK]

[ROR14]
....
.....[BRK]

[ROR08]
Hiro! Why did you...[BRK]

[ROR14]
Ha ha ha! Poor, lost, little
Lucia. You care for Hiro
more than yourself.[BRK]

That's so touching. You
know, there is a way you can
save your true love...[BRK]

If you were to give me the
secret of the Blue Tower's
true power, I could...[BRK]

[ROR08]
Ghaleon! How do you know
about the Blue Tower's
secret power?![BRK]

[ROR14]
Ha ha ha. I know many 
things, my dear.[BRK]

I also know that you now 
control the destiny of your
little Hiro.[BRK]

Go to Pentagulia and finish
your mission, or return to 
the Blue Tower to save Hiro.[BRK]

It's up to you...hm hm hm
hm hm hm....
[END]

=== 40 | ada8 | 16e ===
[POR02]
Oh no! Hiro! Hiro!
Lucia, you have to save
Hiro! Please???[BRK]

[POR05]
Looks like our luck's taken
a turn for the worse...
damn that Ghaleon![BRK]

[POR07]
If Ghaleon can change a
human into crystal, who can
stop him?[BRK]

[POR10]
Lucia has the power to save
Hiro and stop Ghaleon...he
said it himself...[BRK]

[POR08]
If I use the secret power of
the Blue Tower, I can save
Hiro...[BRK]

...but that would...
[END]

=== 41 | af36 | 1c6 ===
[POR08]
....
.....Hiro.[BRK]

If the world is destroyed
because of my decision,
you'll never forgive me.[BRK]

Before I met you, my 
thoughts were so clear.[BRK]

I had simply to come here
and accomplish my simple
mission. But now...[BRK]

Oh, Hiro! What shall I do?
Nothing makes sense anymore.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Regardless of what happens,
know that I will always...[BRK]

[POR02]
...Lucia! It's the Blue
Tower! We're here! Let's
get moving and restore Hiro![BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

...okay, Ruby. I'm coming.[END]

=== 42 | b114 | 1cd ===
[POR01]
C'mon, Lucia! Grandpa
Gwyn is waiting for us![BRK]

[POR08]
Yes, I suppose we should
continue on...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...but...[BRK]

[POR01]
But what, Lucia?
What's the matter?[BRK]

[POR08]
No...nothing. Forget it.[BRK]

I'm just glad to know
that someone will always
be here for me.[BRK]

[POR01]
That's kind of a weird
thing to say out of the
blue...[BRK]

Of course you'll always
have me around![BRK]

[POR08]
Y-you're right. From now
on, no more bad thoughts![BRK]

Okay. As Ruby would say,[BRK]

'let's get this show on
the road, Hiro!'
[END]

=== 43 | b2ee | 229 ===
[POR01]
Penny for your thoughts,
Lucia.[BRK]

[POR08]
Hmm? Oh, Hiro.[BRK]

[POR01]
You seemed to be lost in
pretty deep thought. What
were you thinking about?[BRK]

[POR08]
Oh, nothing, really...[BRK]

I-i was just wishing we
could continue this journey
forever...[BRK]

I know it's silly.[BRK]

[POR01]
Oh, Lucia. It's not that
stupid.[BRK]

I've had that same thought
myself. Ya know, after we
visit gramps,[BRK]

we can take the Destiny and
start another adventure![BRK]

Whaddaya think? Cool, huh?[BRK]

[POR08]
That sounds lovely, Hiro.
I'd die to do that...[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

[POR01]
Okay then! We'll call it
a plan! I can't wait!
This'll be great!
[END]

=== 44 | b520 | fc ===
[POR01]
It looks like we're here.
We'd better get moving! I
can't wait to tell grand...[BRK]

[POR08]
...wait! Hiro, I'd like to
stop at the Blue Tower
first.[BRK]

[POR01]
But...Lucia? Why can't we
visit Grandpa Gwyn first?[BRK]

[POR08]
Please, Hiro? For me?[BRK]

[POR01]
...okay, Lucia. For you.

[END]

=== 45 | b644 | b9 ===
[POR02]
Remember, Leo said the cave
of the White Dragon was in
an iceberg by the North Sea.[BRK]

If we leave Meribia's port
and head west, we're sure
to find it.[BRK]

Let's go, Hiro! Adventure
awaits![END]

=== 46 | b730 | 51 ===
[POR09]
There's no time for
indecision, lad! Zophar
will be here any time![BRK]

Let's move![END]

=== 47 | b794 | bf ===
[POR08]
Oh, Hiro. You sacrificed
your life so that I 
could live.[BRK]

I owe you everything.[BRK]

[POR02]
Lucia, we have to hurry
and get to the Blue Spire
to restore Hiro.[BRK]

[POR08]
But there's no time.
Zophar is...

[END]

=== 48 | b866 | 83 ===
[POR08]
Oh, Hiro! How can I even
consider leaving you in
this state?![BRK]

There must be a way to
revive you and still take
care of Zophar...[END]

=== 49 | b8f6 | 4f ===
[POR08]
But my first priority is
to use the power of the 
Blue Spire to revive you.
[END]

=== 4a | b95c | 1eb ===
[POR05]
Are you going to save 
Hiro by using the power
of the Blue Spire?[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[BRK]

Ronfar, continue the course
to Pentagulia.[BRK]

[POR05]
But that's the opposite
direction of the Blue Spire![BRK]

If you don't go there and
restore Hiro, that will be
the...end...of...him...[BRK]

[POR02]
He was stricken trying to
save your life! How can you
turn your back on him now?[BRK]

[POR08]
Ruby, please understand. I
must accomplish my task, or
all will be...[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm not listening! La la la
la la la la la la la la la 
la la la.....


[END]

=== 4b | bb5e | 2e7 ===
[POR05]
Listen, I know how important
it is not to let Zophar 
revive, [BRK]

but I will not let Hiro die
like this! I'm going to the
port at Dalton.[BRK]

I can take him to the Blue
Spire from there.[BRK]

Maybe I can figure out how
to revive him. You can do
what you want.[BRK]

[POR08]
Ronfar, you don't understand
anything![BRK]

If Zophar revives before
Althena, he will seize
Althena's power,[BRK]

and become the most powerful
being in the universe,[BRK]

with the absolute power of
creation and destruction.[BRK]

Once his evil is infused
with this power, it will be
the end of everything![BRK]

This is our only chance to
stop him.[BRK]

[POR02]
But Lucia...[BRK]

[POR08]
I am Lucia, guardian of the
Blue Star. I came here to
save the world.[BRK]

I must continue my mission,
regardless of the cost.[BRK]

Do what you must, Ronfar.
[END]

=== 4c | be4e | 49 ===

is the last chance to save
Hiro![BRK]

[POR08]
....

=== 4d | beae | 106 ===
[POR05]
I knew you'd change your
mind, Lucia.[BRK]

I know that you are gambling
with the fate of both our
worlds to do this.[BRK]

But you're doing the right
thing by going to the Blue
Spire first to save Hiro.[BRK]

Trust me...it'll all be
peachy keen, jelly bean.
...you'll see....
[END]

=== 4e | bfc8 | 9b ===
[POR10]
Lucia...why do you hesitate?
You aren't thinking of
letting Hiro die, are you?[BRK]

I know you're not that
cold-hearted! You simply
can't be...[BRK]

[POR08]
....
.....[END]

=== 4f | c076 | 98 ===
[POR10]
Whew! For a while there, I
was worried that you were
going to let Hiro die![BRK]

But you've now shown that
you have the one trait I
prize most: integrity.[END]

=== 50 | c122 | b4 ===
[POR07]
With money, practically
anything is possible...[BRK]

But I'm pretty sure that
there's no way we can buy
Hiro back from the dead.[BRK]

You've got to save him,
Lucia![BRK]

[POR08]
But Lemina...i...
