In order to beat Borgan and
see my mother back safe, we
need the right tools.[BRK]

I'd better open the
treasures of Vane so we
can use them.[BRK]

I think I can work out a
good deal on the rental
of them...[BRK]

...Oh, what the heck! I'll
let you guys use them for
free...[BRK]

...After all, you are
rescuing my mother.[END]

=== 1 | dc06 | 7d ===
[POR22]
Ah, Borgan, to what do we
owe the pleasure of this
visit?[BRK]

[POR17]
Miria, you are the picture
of mannerly perfection, as
always.[END]

=== 2 | dc8c | 1fa ===
[POR17]
Vane has fallen into decline
since the Guild fell apart.
You know it's true.[BRK]

Now, simple people who know
nothing of the way of magic
roam its streets.[BRK]

Disgrace and despair are all
that are left for Vane.[BRK]

[POR22]
Then why have you come to
this place you hold in such
low esteem?[BRK]

[POR17]
Ah, Miria, you never were
one to skirt the issue.[BRK]

So then, I'll get to the
point. I have a selfish
reason for coming here.[BRK]

Now that this town no longer
suits a woman of your
stature,[BRK]

I have come to take you with
me to Neo-Vane.[END]

=== 3 | de90 | 62 ===
[POR07]
Oughh! That flying cesspool
has no right to come in here
like he owns the place![BRK]

I'll show him![END]

=== 4 | df06 | 11e ===
[POR22]
Lemina, my dear, you've
returned![BRK]

And you've brought some new
friends with you. Introduce
me, won't you?[BRK]

[POR07]
These are not just friends
of mine,[BRK]

they're candidates to become
members of the new Magic
Guild.[BRK]

I'm gathering new candidates
every day. I will revive the
Guild some day soon![END]

=== 5 | e04e | 40 ===
[POR22]
That's nice, dear. By the
way, this is Borgan, from
Neo-Vane.[END]

=== 6 | e092 | 166 ===
[POR22]
Borgan is one of the Four
Heroes of Althena.[BRK]

He worked very hard and
became the leader of Neo-
Vane.[BRK]

[POR07]
So?[BRK]

Everyone knows that Neo-
Vane is a pale imitation of
the original.[BRK]

Why are you so nice to him,
mother? Before, you were...[BRK]

[POR22]
Lemina! Mind your manners!
Borgan is a very powerful
man.[BRK]

[POR07]
Pooh! I don't understand
you, Mother. He's just
trying to...[END]

=== 7 | e218 | 10a ===
[POR22]
Lemina, you will treat
Borgan with respect while
he is here.[BRK]

[POR07]
But Mother! He's trying to
make sure Vane's Magic Guild
never comes back![BRK]

Can't you see that?[BRK]

[POR22]
Lemina, as my daughter, you
must obey my wishes. [BRK]

Now, leave us. We have
important matters to
discuss.[END]

=== 8 | e342 | 98 ===
[POR22]
Lemina, watch your tongue!
Guests in our house are to
be treated with respect![BRK]

Please take your friends and
go. Borgan and I have
matters to discuss.[END]

=== 9 | e3fe | 219 ===
[POR22]
Hiro, come closer...I have
an urgent request to make
of you.[BRK]

[POR01]
.....
......[BRK]

[POR22]
Please, go find my daughter
Lemina.[BRK]

She's such an impulsive
girl.[BRK]

I know that she'd like
Borgan, if she'd just get
to know him.[BRK]

[POR02]
But that floating dump
is a loser! I know it![BRK]

Just say 'no.'[BRK]

[POR22]
You don't understand. Borgan
has a heart of gold.[BRK]

He's just not very good
at relating to others.[BRK]

Please, just find Lemina and
let her know I'll be fine.[BRK]

Once you find her, please
come back and let me know
she understands...[BRK]

I don't want to worry
about her...
[END]

=== a | e63e | 95 ===
[POR22]
Hiro! What are you doing
back here? You didn't find
my daughter, did you?![BRK]

Please! You must find Lemina
and explain that I'll be
fine with Borgan.[END]

=== b | e6f2 | ac ===
[POR22]
Hiro, I thought you were a
bright boy!?! What are you
doing back here?[BRK]

I need you to get my message
to Lemina.[BRK]

Please find her and explain
that I'll be okay with
Borgan.[END]

=== c | e7be | 28e ===
[POR22]
Now that you've seen Lemina
and the others, you know
they have the will to fight.[BRK]

They're never going to
surrender our world to
Zophar.[BRK]

They believe in the power
of each other, and have the
will to overcome anything.[BRK]

You taught them that,
Hiro.[BRK]

[POR01]
.....!?[BRK]

[POR22]
But if you forget to believe
in yourself, Lucia truly
will be lost.[BRK]

And none of us want to see
that...[BRK]

[POR01]
But...Miria...I...
...I...[BRK]

[POR22]
Shhh! I'm still not sure
this is the right thing
to do,[BRK]

because I was told not to
tell anyone is this,[BRK]

but I think you're just
what this person needs
right now.[BRK]

Go to the roof.[BRK]

Someone is waiting there...[BRK]

Go! Quickly now...See for
yourself...on the roof.

[END]

=== d | ea64 | 90 ===
[POR22]
Hiro, why do you hesitate?
Are you afraid of who might
be waiting for you?[BRK]

Why have you suddenly turned
afraid? Go to the roof and 
find out![END]

=== e | eb08 | 16d ===
[POR22]
Ghaleon...That name has been
stained in blood on this
place for centuries...[BRK]

Descendants of this city
lived in shame for years
because of his actions...[BRK]

But I always felt he must
have regretted his course
after it was too late.[BRK]

I sensed a very quiet
sadness in the things he
wrote before his death.[BRK]

To have all that power, and
yet...to be lonely beyond
words...
[END]

=== f | ec88 | ef ===
[POR22]
So, I was right! Ghaleon has
come back to try to right
the wrongs he committed.[BRK]

Hiro, now your task carries
even greater weight. Ghaleon
is counting on you, too.[BRK]

With Lemina at your side, I
pray you can save our world
from annihilation.[END]

=== 10 | ed8a | 94 ===
[POR22]
In our world, the strongest
power is the power of belief
in the human spirit...[BRK]

You have proven that beyond
a shadow of a doubt.[BRK]

Well done, Hiro![END]

=== 11 | ee2c | 4c ===
[POR08]
It's strange...That sounds
like something I heard a
very long time ago...[END]

=== 12 | ee8c | 6d ===
[POR22]
Well, hello there, Hiro!
Long time no see, stranger![BRK]

Have you come to see Lemina?
She's right over there.
[END]

=== 13 | ef08 | ad ===
[POR22]
You will reach Lucia again,
but only if you resolve
never to accept defeat.[BRK]

Try hard, Hiro. Love is
the only thing of true
worth in our world...[BRK]

[POR01]
I will never give up!![END]

=== 14 | efe0 | 179 ===
[POR17]
Gwha ha ha ha! Ah, but I've
changed...Really, I have![BRK]

And I have a very urgent
reason to be here.[BRK]

Perhaps you should catch up
on things with your mother,
dear girl.[BRK]

You may not be able to see
her for a while. She's going
on a...vacation, yes...[BRK]

It is such a pity when
people leave with issues
unresolved...[BRK]

[POR07]
What are you talking about,
Borgan? You haven't changed
a bit!

[END]

=== 15 | f170 | 287 ===
[POR17]
It's such a shame when
places of former glory fall
into neglect...[BRK]

...I'm afraid that's what's
happened to Vane. The hand-
writing's on the walls..[BRK]

[POR07]
What? Vane is not destined
to disappear! I am working
to restore it![BRK]

[POR22]
Calm down, Lemina. Listen to
what Borgan has to say.[BRK]

You know, if you get past
the surface, he's very much
like you...[BRK]

[POR07]
Mother! How can you say such
a terrible thing?!! He's...
...He's......evil![BRK]

Why are you defending him?
He wants to kidnap you! Or
are you under his spell?[BRK]

[POR17]
Gha ha ha! I do not submit
my power for your approval,
dear girl.[BRK]

I am absolute sovereign of
my destiny now. I will do
as I wish. Behold...

[END]

=== 16 | f400 | 2d2 ===
[POR07]
MOTHER!!!![BRK]

[POR17]
Wasn't that delicious? And
all it took was a simple
wave of my Rubenesque hands![BRK]

Poof! Mommy's gone! Gwa ha
ha ha ha![BRK]

[POR07]
Borgan! You oversized fecal
factory! What have you done
with my mother?!![BRK]

I demand that you return her
this minute![BRK]

[POR17]
Gwa ha ha ha! And I demand
that you think before you
speak, dear girl.[BRK]

Think of the power I hold.
I could crush you like a
Twinkie.[BRK]

No, your mother will not be
coming back. She will rule
with me...in Neo-Vane![BRK]

And, oh...if you feel the
need to visit, please stop
by Pentagulia....[BRK]

I have a summer cottage
there Miria might enjoy.[BRK]

We'll be certain to roll out
the...DEAD carpet for you...
Gwa ha ha ha ha...[BRK]

[POR07]
No! Borgan! I'm serious!
Come back here this instant!

[END]

=== 17 | f6dc | 137 ===
[POR07]
Oh, Mother! I can't believe
I let you down![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

With my magic power I'm not
qualified to be a bathroom
attendant...[BRK]

...let alone premier of the
Magic Guild of Vane! Oh...[BRK]

What was I thinking?[BRK]

I can't even save the one
I love most! How can I hope
to restore a whole city?[BRK]

Oh, Mother...I'm a failure!


[END]

=== 18 | f840 | 113 ===
[POR17]
The only real difference
between Miria and I is in
magic power.[BRK]

But you ignorant fools have
lost all your magic power![BRK]

Do you know why you lost
your magic? Hmm?[BRK]

It is because Lucia has
gained the power of Althena
to fight Zophar.[BRK]

All the world's power is at
her command.

[END]

=== 19 | f97a | 99 ===
[POR17]
Lucia has taken the power of
Althena to aid in her fight
against Zophar.[BRK]

Since Althena's power is the
source of this world's
power, there's none left.[END]

=== 1a | fa32 | 80 ===
[POR17]
I once believed that magic
power was everything,[BRK]

but Miria has reminded me of
something more...important.
Gha ha ha ha ha...
[END]

=== 1b | fac6 | 82 ===
[POR17]
I don't understand Ghaleon's
plan in the least. He
doesn't stand a chance.[BRK]

If I still had magic power,
I could help you, but...[END]

=== 1c | fb5c | b1 ===
[POR17]
I'm pleasantly surprised at
your prowess in defeating
Dark Lord Ghaleon.[BRK]

Maybe you do stand a chance
against Zophar after all...[BRK]

Give it your best. I'm
counting on you now...[END]

=== 1d | fc20 | ba ===
[POR17]
Gha ha ha ha! The power of
my love for Miria is strong.[BRK]

Now that this world is at
peace, perhaps she will see
me for what I am...[BRK]

A great big, huggable sugar
daddy who's sweet on her.[END]

=== 1e | fcee | 72 ===
[POR17]
Just having Miria at my
side is sheer perfection.[BRK]

It doesn't get any better
than this, kiddies...[BRK]

Gwa ha ha ha![END]

=== 1f | fd78 | 176 ===
[POR17]
Ah, little Lemina, going
on a trip, I see...Why...
thank you![BRK]

[POR07]
....
.....Huh?[BRK]

[POR17]
I just appreciate the fact
that you want to give me
and Miria some 'alone time.'[BRK]

I can't tell you how much
this means to me...Gha ha
ha ha![BRK]

[POR07]
....
.....[BRK]

Borgan, you are a foul-
minded pig! Call my trip
what you'd like...[BRK]

but I have no intention
of helping you win my
mother's affection!
[END]

=== 20 | ff0a | 1a5 ===
[POR17]
Don't worry, Lemina...I'll
keep an eye on...things...
while you're gone.[BRK]

Gha ha ha ha ha![BRK]

[POR07]
Lay one hand on my mother
and I'll...I'll...[BRK]

[POR17]
You'll what? Call me Daddy?
Gha ha ha ha ha![BRK]

[POR07]
Oouuugh! Borgan! You disgust
me! Your mind is as slimy as
your skin![BRK]

I'll be back, and you had
better not have laid a
finger on my mother...[BRK]

[POR17]
Such an excitable girl. A
finger is not what I
intended to lay...[BRK]

Gha ha ha ha ha...
[END]

=== 21 | 100be | 90 ===
Little Lemina, why do you
waste your time with Vane?[BRK]

It's a memory...a thing of
the past! Neo-Vane is the
future.[BRK]

Come, take hold of it with
us![END]

=== 22 | 1015e | 70 ===
If only Lemina would
swallow her pride, she
would see Borgan's great![BRK]

A fun-loving guy that's
perfect for Miria![END]

=== 23 | 101de | f2 ===
It...It smells like mold
or mildew in here...Whoop![BRK]

Sorry, forgot. This is the
decaying Vane...not my
shiny new Vane...[BRK]

It always smells of the
decaying past in this god-
forsaken place...[BRK]

What I wouldn't give for
a bucket of Lysol right now.[END]

=== 24 | 102e0 | 3c ===
Borgan, Borgan, he's our
man! If he can't do it,
no one can![END]

=== 25 | 1032c | 77 ===
This city reeks of the
depressed memories of the
past.[BRK]

The Vane we have built under
Borgan is shiny, new, and
powerful![END]

=== 26 | 103b2 | bb ===
The fact that Vane's Magic
Guild has no members should
give you the clue...[BRK]

Face it, sister! Vane is
a ghost town.[BRK]

But don't worry. We'll carry
the name forward in Neo-
Vane! Ha ha ha ha![END]

=== 27 | 10484 | 1f4 ===
[POR07]
Oh, hi, Hiro! Welcome back
to the great city of Vane![BRK]

Have you finally decided to
join the Guild? Let's see,
where are those contracts...[BRK]

...Oh, is Lucia with you?
She probably wants to join,
too.[BRK]

...
....[BRK]

What?!! Lucia went back to
the Blue Star?!...Alone?
That's...terrible![BRK]

Ah...I'm beginning to get
the picture...[BRK]

You came here to get me to
help you go after Lucia!
I'm with you now...[BRK]

Let's see...That should only
run you about 10,000s,[BRK]

a special price for a
special friend...What do
you say?[END]

=== 28 | 1067c | 2e ===
[0x5]Hmmm, I'll think about it.
Whatever it takes![END]

=== 29 | 106ba | b4 ===
[POR07]
If you have to think about
it, you must not care for
her too much.[BRK]

I should think that 10,000s
would be so cheap you'd be
diving for the deal![BRK]

Does Lucia know how cheap
you are?[END]

=== 2a | 10784 | 102 ===
[POR07]
It takes a lot of love to
go after someone regardless
of the odds...[BRK]

Oohhmmm...I hope I meet a
man just like you someday.[BRK]

Anyway, the price was just
to see how serious you were.[BRK]

Did you really think I would
charge a friend? C'mon! This
one's on the house![END]

=== 2b | 108ae | a0 ===
[POR07]
The help of the Premier of
the Vane Magic Guild won't
come cheap, of course.[BRK]

But since you're a special
friend, I'll give you a
discount. How about 10,000s?

That's private, you know.
Those are my deepest and

...Oh, how I wish getting
Vane off the ground was not
such a lonely task.[BRK]

I mean, I enjoy it, and I'm
making some good progress,[BRK]

but the job is just such a
lonely crusade at times. Mia
must have known this, too.[BRK]

Oh, Althena, where's my
Nash? You know, my studmuf-

Ah, well...someday. Good-
bye for now, diary.

The battle we are about to
fight frightens me greatly.
Zophar is indestructible...[BRK]

...At least, that's the way
it seems now that he has
the power of Althena.[BRK]

But I'll give it my best,
because I believe in the
power of good.[BRK]

And I have good people to
fight alongside.[BRK]

Wish me luck, diary...I'll
be needing it.

Well, diary, the fight for
our world went better than
I had hoped.[BRK]

Zophar was all bark and no
bite, it seems.[BRK]

Well, maybe it just seemed
that way because the party
fought so bravely.[BRK]

Anyway...I'm glad that one's
behind me. Now all I have
to do is get rid of Borgan![BRK]

That overgrown garbage dump
is still here oogling my
mother![BRK]

I'll get that vulgar magic-

it kills me![BRK]

I'll let you know how it
goes tomorrow.

Much has happened since we

It...It seems like ages ago.[BRK]

You've shown me so much of
this wonderful land.[BRK]

The cool breezes that blow
in the afternoon. The warm
sands of the beach.[BRK]

...And most of all, the kind
people, whose spirit cannot
be broken in adversity.[BRK]

I want the Blue Star to be
all of these things and
more...someday.[BRK]

I'm so glad that you were
the first person I met here.
Thank you, Hiro.[BRK]

If you think she needs a pep
talk, why don't you run over

Sure...G...Go ahead and

Magic G-Guild, but she's
the only member.[BRK]

I-I-I'm just a b-big joke!
I didn't even have the power

I can't even raise enough
money to fix the leaky roof

Oh, Hiro! I'm just a big

[0x5]Uh, want a donation?
No, Vane is wonderful![END]

[ROR07]
What is this? Pity money?[BRK]

You just feel sorry for me
now. I never wanted that.[END]

=== 46 | 12e7c | 41 ===
[ROR07]
...But I'll take your money
in good f-faith. Thank
you, Hiro.
[END]

=== 47 | 12ed0 | 49 ===
[ROR07]
Oh, Hiro...Just leave me
alone. I have to figure
this out for myself.

Lemina, Vane is a wonderful
town, with a rich history
of wonderful leaders.[BRK]

I think that you will be the
next great leader of Vane.
I believe in your dream.[BRK]

[ROR07]
....
.....[BRK]

[ROR01]
Someday you will restore
this town to its past glory.[BRK]

Someday the Vane Magic Guild
will once again be the
center of this world.[BRK]

And someday, everyone will
know the vision you had that
made it all possible.[BRK]

[ROR07]
....
.....[BRK]

Thanks, Hiro. I needed to
hear that.[END]

[ROR05]
Hey there, Lemina. It's no
shame if you're the only
member of the Guild![BRK]

Hell, if you're the only
gambler, it's a sure bet
all you'll do is win![BRK]

So, the way I look at it,
you can't lose.[BRK]

[ROR10]
And I'll join as a member
of the Guild...that is, if
you'll have me.[BRK]

I'll support your dream any
way I can.[BRK]

[ROR08]
I don't know much about the
people of this world,[BRK]

but I do know that you are
doing the right thing,
Lemina.[BRK]

Follow your dream always,
and your regrets will be
few.[BRK]

[ROR07]
....
.....[BRK]

I...I feel so bad. My only
thought was how to get you
to join the Guild.[BRK]

But you...you were all
concerned about me...me...
personally![END]

=== 4a | 13372 | 110 ===
[ROR07]
I...I'm okay now. Let's
get moving.[BRK]

We've got to go see Borgan
in Pentagulia to save my
mother![BRK]

That lard-butt is going to
pay dearly for putting me
through this![BRK]

[ROR02]
Does she really think we
bought the 'dirt in her
eye' routine?[BRK]

Why can't she just admit
she was crying?[END]

=== 4b | 1349e | db ===
[ROR07]
Mother...Oh, mother! If I
didn't have the magic power
to save you,[BRK]

how can I hope to restore
the once-great city of
Vane?[BRK]

No...I will rescue you,
Mother. And I will restore
Vane.[BRK]

And I won't rest until it's
done...

I know that I am not fit
to fight with you.[BRK]

But now that Zophar has
gained Althena's power,
I cannot sit and watch.[BRK]

I feel that I am responsible
in part for this. After all,
I served in Althena's Guard.[BRK]

In fact, I was serving the
lord of evil himself,
Zophar.[BRK]

Hiro, when we fought, White
Knight Leo of Althena's
Guard died.[BRK]

Please let me fight at your
side as a fellow crusader
for justice![BRK]

The Destiny awaits...please
consider my request.
[END]

=== 4d | 13754 | 86 ===
[ROR02]
Leo, come! Fight with us.[BRK]

If we all gather together,
Zophar won't stand a chance
of winning![BRK]

[ROR01]

[ROR02]
Hiro!?![BRK]

[POR14]
You know, if you die without
crying,[BRK]

I just might be persuaded
to tell Lucia you died
bravely.[BRK]

She calls your name in her
sleep, you know...[BRK]

[POR01]
Lucia...[BRK]

...calls for me?[BRK]

[POR14]
Yes...[BRK]

...Pathetic, isn't it?[BRK]

The poor girl has no taste
at all, it seems...[BRK]

But no matter. You'll soon
be out of the picture...
forever.[BRK]

But first, I'll let you
watch as I kill every
citizen of Vane.[BRK]

There's really no pleasure
in doing it if you're all,
well...dead.[BRK]

Watch in horror as I give
you a preview of the show
Zophar has planned![BRK]

See you soon...Ha ha ha!

Oh no, Hiro![BRK]

We're in deep guacamole!
Ghaleon didn't sound like
he was bluffing![BRK]

[POR01]
He won't get away with this![BRK]

C'mon, Ruby. We're going to
stop him or die trying![END]
