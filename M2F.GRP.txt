Heh heh heh....[BRK]

The competition is about to
begin. We've already sold 
more tickets than expected.[BRK]

In fact, we're sold out!! [BRK]

Boy, this year looks like
it's gonna be the bloodiest
yet![BRK]

If you don't have a good
stomach, you'll be heavin'
before the second round![BRK]

[POR10]
I think i have the stomach
for it.[BRK]

In fact, our team is in
the competition this year![BRK]

See?[BRK]

[POR00]
[0xB][0][0x5]Showed the invitation.[END]

=== 1 | 181f0 | 125 ===
Heh heh...you must be one
crazy freak to enter this
competition.[BRK]

These guys play for keeps,
and you don't look like the
type to stop them.[BRK]

The only trick you're gonna
manage is to bleed all over
the mat![BRK]

Talk about an easy win![BRK]

I gotta find out what kind
of odds they're putting on
your match![END]

=== 2 | 18328 | 79 ===
Hey! What are you kids
doing in here?[BRK]

This is a tournament for
karate masters only![BRK]

You know...invitation
only![BRK]

So scram![END]

=== 3 | 183c8 | 69 ===
I can't wait for the title
match.[BRK]

Last year there was so much
blood spilled that the blood
bank ran out! [END]

=== 4 | 18444 | cf ===
Heh, heh, heh...[BRK]

I just love the color of
blood. It's just sooo...
...red![BRK]

Just make sure that during
your match you try to get
in at least one face-crush![BRK]

No one likes a boring match![BRK]

Blood, blood, blood!

[END]

=== 5 | 1852a | 79 ===
The competition is all over.[BRK]

You know, it really wasn't
that bloody this year.[BRK]

Or maybe i'm getting
desensitized to it...[END]

=== 6 | 185b4 | 1c9 ===
[POR02]
You retard! If you like
the sight of blood so much,[BRK]

why don't you spill a little
of your own?[BRK]

[POR00]
What a novel idea. I didn't
even think of that!![BRK]

<Whack> <slam> <bam> [BRK]

Heh heh heh, i just gave
myself a bloody nose![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Look!......look at the
blood! Wooowwww![BRK]

[POR02]
...whew! This guy needs some
serious help![BRK]

I'm thinking...[BRK]

Sad-[BRK]

Sad-o-[BRK]

Sad-o-mas-[BRK]

Sad-o-mas-o-[BRK]

Sad-o-mas-o-chist...[BRK]

Big time![BRK]

Let's get out of here
before he gets any new
bloody ideas!

=== 7 | 18798 | 92 ===
I've hit myself so many 
times in the head that I
have a headache.[BRK]

But man! Can my head
bleed![BRK]

It was spewing like old
faithful![BRK]

Talk about cool!
[END]

=== 8 | 1883a | 69 ===
I've seen so much of my
blood during the last few
minutes that...[BRK]

Well, this is a shock! The
winner of this year's 
competition is...[BRK]

Jean's dojo![BRK]

[POR05]
Darn! In all the excitement,
i forgot to place a bet. [BRK]

[POR10]
It's time to face lunn.[BRK]

Someone has to stop him! I
just hope i'm ready...[END]

=== 13 | 18e40 | a3 ===
Whew! Talk about humiliating
a guy![BRK]

You completely wasted the
blue karate master![BRK]

I've never seen anyone fight
like you before.[BRK]

Say, can i...have your
autograph?

[END]

=== 14 | 18ef2 | 73 ===
You must be one of the
most gifted fighters
anywhere![BRK]

I can't wait to see what
you do in next year's
competition.

[END]

=== 15 | 18f72 | 7a ===
[POR10]
I can tell you what i'll
do next year right now.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I won't be here. And,
hopefully, this barbarism
will cease![END]

=== 16 | 18ffa | a5 ===
[POR07]
Come on, jean! I could
promote you![BRK]

We could make some really
big bucks![BRK]

Don't worry, i won't become 
like don king![BRK]

All i want is three-fourths
of the profits!

[END]

=== 17 | 190b6 | e5 ===
The competition is set up
so that whoever wins will
proceed to the next bout.[BRK]

Losers will be carried out
in shame to have their
wounds attended.[BRK]

There are eight teams of
three participating this
year.[BRK]

It looks like a tough
field.[END]

=== 18 | 1919e | 72 ===
Well, let's begin the first
round. Is your team ready  
to fight?      
[0x5]We're ready.
I'd like a few more minutes.[END]

=== 19 | 19220 | 37 ===
Good. Now which three from
your group will be fighting?[END]

=== 1a | 19260 | 294 ===
[POR10]
I will be the team leader.[BRK]

Hiro will be second.[BRK]

...that is, if you would
like to fight with me,
hiro.[BRK]

Great! I knew you would.[BRK]

And the last one will be...[BRK]

[POR05]
Jean, you don't have to 
ask. I know as the only guy
left you have to choose me.[BRK]

[POR07]
Don't you know that women
are just as good as men
these days?[BRK]

[POR05]
Ookey-dokey...fine then!
Lemina, why don't you take
my place...[BRK]

[POR07]
Ha! Just watch me kick their
mega-sorry butts![BRK]

[POR05]
...but you do know that
there's no money in it
for you, don't you?[BRK]

[POR07]
....
.....[BRK]

Well, jean, good luck.
I'll stand right over there
and cheer for all of you![BRK]

[POR10]
I don't think we'll have any
trouble in this first round.[BRK]

Here we go!


[END]

=== 1b | 19516 | 60 ===
We can't start the second
round until all the first
round matches are over.[BRK]

Just wait a while...[END]

=== 1c | 19580 | 3e ===
Waaaahhhhhhhh!!![BRK]

[POR02]
Whew! What the heck is
going on up there?![END]

=== 1d | 195c8 | 69 ===
Your karate is a disgrace
to this tournament.[BRK]

You should never have
challenged us, weaklings![BRK]

Take this!![END]

=== 1e | 1963a | af ===
Ha ha ha...what a pathetic
waste of skin![BRK]

They deserved to be
terminated![BRK]

Soon, all will know the
strength of the blue
dragon cult![BRK]

We will reign supreme over
this tournament![END]

=== 1f | 196f2 | 105 ===
[POR01]
...![BRK]

[POR02]
I...i can't believe what I
just witnessed![BRK]

It was sick! The fight was
already over and they just
...well...you know...[BRK]

[POR10]
The karate of the blue
dragon cult is nothing but
evil.[BRK]

There is no mercy shown to
opponents. It must be
stopped at any cost.


[END]

=== 20 | 1980c | 59 ===
Listen, you don't have a
minute.[BRK]

If you miss the start of the
match, you're disqualified.[END]

=== 21 | 19894 | 7f ===
The second level round of 
the tournament is ready to
begin. Are you ready?
[0x5]As ready as we'll ever be.
Can we take a breather?[END]

=== 22 | 19922 | 1a ===
Then let the match begin!
[END]

=== 23 | 1995e | c1 ===
You've won![BRK]

You are now qualified to
compete in the final match.[BRK]

Your opponent is the clan
of the blue dragon cult.[BRK]

[POR02]
Be careful, hiro![BRK]

These guys are dangerous![BRK]

You saw what they did
earlier![END]

=== 24 | 19a34 | 6d ===
If you need a break, you
won't stand a chance against
the cult![BRK]

Enjoy the break. It'll
probably be your last.[END]

=== 25 | 19ab4 | 94 ===
Okay, the next match is
set to begin.[BRK]

Your opponents are from the
cult of the blue dragon.[BRK]

Are you ready?
[0x5]You'd better believe it!
No...i'm scared![END]

=== 26 | 19b58 | cb ===
Then let the final battle
begin![BRK]

[POR10]
Hiro, ronfar, these guys
don't mess around. They're
cold-blooded killers.[BRK]

Don't lower your guard for
even a second![BRK]

Remember what i've taught
you, and follow my lead!
[END]

=== 27 | 19c44 | 174 ===
Whuh ho! What a fight!![BRK]

That was incredible![BRK]

The winners are the clan
of jean's dojo![BRK]

[POR02]
Ha! I knew you'd kick their
blue bottoms![BRK]

I wasn't worried for a
second![BRK]

[POR05]
What's this 'us,' ruby? All
you did was sit on your pink
bottom and watch.[BRK]

[POR02]
I'm sorry. Did anyone hear
that?[BRK]

I could've sworn i heard
some annoying person
talking.[BRK]

Hmm...maybe it was just my
imagination...[END]

=== 28 | 19dce | 3d ===
Scared or not, this is no
time to back out. Get in 
the ring![END]

=== 29 | 19e1e | fb ===
This competition used to be
a peaceful event.[BRK]

But now, i think lunn uses
it as a recruiting ground.[BRK]

He's here today talking
about his new all-powerful
black karate of death.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

There's something wrong with
that guy. I think he's
turned evil...[END]

=== 2a | 19f2c | 7b ===
We have been studying the
teachings of master lunn.[BRK]

But after your display of
fighting prowess, we'd like
to follow you...
[END]

=== 2b | 19fb6 | 6f ===
Master lunn will no doubt
want to see you.[BRK]

He doesn't appreciate being
upstaged in the tournament
by newcomers.[END]

=== 2c | 1a03c | 181 ===
[POR16]
Hrmph...jean! I see you
found your way out of
your cell.[BRK]

Did you claw your way out
just to fight me?[BRK]

I'm flattered.[BRK]

[POR10]
Don't be.[BRK]

I came here to stop you from
corrupting the minds of
any more innocent children.[BRK]

I will fight until my last
breath to stop your wicked
cult.[BRK]

[POR16]
My, my, i don't think i've
ever seen you so focused.[BRK]

You must be quite serious in
your intent, foolish girl.
[END]

=== 2d | 1a1d8 | 175 ===
[POR16]
My blue dragon cult will
dominate this competition.[BRK]

I have trained each and
every one of them
personally.[BRK]

In order for you to fight
me, you must first defeat
my followers.[BRK]

And in that endeavor, I
expect you to fail
miserably![BRK]

Ha ha ha ha![BRK]

[POR10]
Lunn, i give you my word.[BRK]

I will not rest until I
have defeated you.[BRK]

I will defeat your
followers. And then, i'm
coming for you![END]

=== 2e | 1a360 | 100 ===
[POR16]
Ha ha ha! Why have you
come back to me?[BRK]

You defeated the babies of
this tournament. You're
no match for me![BRK]

There are more rounds yet
to go. We'll see how you
fare in them...[BRK]

[POR10]
If this is as hard as it
gets, you'd better start 
looking for a back door.[END]

=== 2f | 1a474 | 19e ===
[POR16]
At last, the time has come
for my precious cult to
show you the light.[BRK]

Your next match is with
the best of my clan.[BRK]

And remember, once you are
lying on the mat drained of
power, do not beg for mercy.[BRK]

My clan has been trained to
ignore the anguished pleas
of the damned.[BRK]

[POR10]
I know your evil ways, lunn.
But this time, there will be
no anguish on my part.[BRK]

I will win this next match.
And then i'm coming for
you.
[END]

=== 30 | 1a62a | 115 ===
[POR16]
Ha! So, the student has
returned to the master.[BRK]

But she has the black mist
of revenge in her eyes.[BRK]

You're a fool for returning,
jean.[BRK]

[POR10]
I am not here for revenge.
I've come to right a wrong
that has slipped my grasp.[BRK]

Until now.[BRK]

Lunn, your misuse of karate
must stop...now!
[END]

=== 31 | 1a74c | 1a3 ===
[POR10]
If i win this match, you
will stop corrupting the
art of karate.[BRK]

And you will free all the
children you yet hold under
your spell.[BRK]

[POR16]
Ha ha ha! I find it amusing
that you are even enter-
taining the hope of winning.[BRK]

This match is a match to the
death. There can be only one
winner.[BRK]

And when i win, i will kill
all your associates, too.[BRK]

When you challenge me, you
agree to these terms.[BRK]

It's your choice, little
one.

[END]

=== 32 | 1a8f2 | 32 ===
[0x5]Um, let me think about it.
I will stop you, lunn![END]

=== 33 | 1a934 | ac ===
[POR16]
Ha ha ha...[BRK]

Indecision in what should
be your finest hour?[BRK]

I thought you were better
than this.[BRK]

Come back when you truly
have the fortitude to face
your end. Ha ha ha...[END]

=== 34 | 1a9f2 | 3a6 ===
[POR10]
I know i can win, but i need
to know that you all agree
that i should fight.[BRK]

After all, if i lose, lunn
has vowed to kill all of
you, too.[BRK]

[POR07]
Go for it, jean![BRK]

I know you have the skill to
beat this guy into a pile of
mega-waste![BRK]

[POR05]
Yeah, jean. We all believe
in you.[BRK]

In fact, i found a place
that gave me 10 to 1 odds
on you winning.[BRK]

I'm gonna make a killing![BRK]

[POR10]
You...bet...on...?!![BRK]

...uh...thanks, ronfar.[BRK]

That bet is the highest vote
of confidence you could have
given me.[BRK]

[POR08]
Jean, you must fight well.[BRK]

The entire future of this
world rests on this battle.[BRK]

If we do not get the blue
dragon aura, we cannot
complete my quest.[BRK]

And all will be lost.[BRK]

[POR10]
Don't worry, lucia. I've
waited all my life for
this moment.[BRK]

It's strange. I've dreamt
of this moment for so long,
i'm not even afraid.[BRK]

The need to stop lunn once
and for all has consumed
me.[BRK]

I will not fail.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Okay, lunn! It's just you
and me, now.[BRK]

Get in the ring!


[END]

=== 35 | 1add2 | 332 ===
[POR16]
Well...well done, jean.
But ho...how can...[BRK]

This makes...no sense...
...i...am...the master![BRK]

We share the knowledge of
blue dragon karate, but
yours is somehow different.[BRK]

[POR10]
I fight not to kill, but
to conquer.[BRK]

My blue dragon karate is
never used aggressively.[BRK]

Once i believed in the power
of good within my soul,[BRK]

i knew i could never be
overcome by evil again.[BRK]

Your power draws from the
well of darkness and
corruption.[BRK]

It will always be overcome
by the power of good.[BRK]

[POR16]
You have proven the power
that can be attained when
the mind and heart...[BRK]

...are united. When that
happens, nothing is
insurmountable.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

So, now you will spare my
life, even though i was
intent on ending yours.[BRK]

Jean, you truly have become
the master.[BRK]

I am humbled before you.[BRK]

Please find it in your heart
to forgive me.[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[END]

=== 36 | 1b10e | a0 ===
[POR08]
...lunn, you must surrender
the blue dragon's aura.[BRK]

[POR16]
Certainly.[BRK]

Here, take it. I have no
use for it any longer.[BRK]

[POR00]
[0xB][0][0x6]Received the aura of the
blue dragon![END]

=== 37 | 1b1b8 | 1ca ===
[POR16]
The sanctuary of the blue 
dragon is located in a cave
north of here.[BRK]

However, you can't reach
it by heading directly
north.[BRK]

Follow the river back to
horam, then head south and
east.[BRK]

The river will then lead 
you north.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I know that you will find
success in your quest.[BRK]

Jean, my new training will
be based on the knowledge
that you imparted to me.[BRK]

You have my word on that.[BRK]

I just hope that you find
it in your heart to
forgive me.[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[END]

=== 38 | 1b39e | 60 ===
[POR16]
Our fight is to the death.[BRK]

And once i am victorious,
i will eliminate your
friends, as well.
[END]

=== 39 | 1b41a | 1f0 ===
[POR16]
Jean, listen to me. I
was not always the monster
you have come to know.[BRK]

When i started, karate was
a way to defend myself.[BRK]

I enjoyed the peace of mind
practice brought, and i no
longer feared anyone.[BRK]

However, i forgot that
original peace, and began to
crave power.[BRK]

That's when i sold my soul
to zophar.[BRK]

I began to teach blue dragon
karate, twisted for my own
selfish purposes.[BRK]

This defeat has shown me the
original way once again.[BRK]

I am forever in your debt.
Please...forgive me.[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....
[END]

=== 3a | 1b626 | dc ===
[POR16]
Take the blue dragon aura
i have given you and go to
the blue dragon sanctuary.[BRK]

Release the blue dragon-
power from the seal and
stop zophar.[BRK]

I believe in you.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I hope one day you can
believe in me again.


[END]

=== 3b | 1b71a | 77 ===
[POR16]
I will retrain myself in
the teachings of my old
master.[BRK]

The way of truth will once
again shine brightly before
me.
[END]

=== 3c | 1b7a8 | f7 ===
[POR16]
Jean, i'm developing a new
karate. It is holy karate.[BRK]

This is what my former
master taught me, and i will
teach it to my students.[BRK]

It is but the first step in
my redemption.[BRK]

One day, i hope you find it
in your heart to forgive me.[BRK]

[POR10]
....
.....[END]

=== 3d | 1b8ba | 81 ===
[POR16]
Holy karate has become my
life.[BRK]

I teach only the use of
karate for defense, now.[BRK]

Soon, aggression will be
a thing of the past.[END]

=== 3e | 1b952 | 1dd ===
[POR16]
Ah, jean! It's been so long
since i last saw you.[BRK]

As i promised, the way of
blue dragon karate is taught
no more.[BRK]

In fact, the mention of that
name is forbidden.[BRK]

The punishment for doing so
is a good caning.[BRK]

Only one has been foolish
enough to spray paint the
name on these walls...[BRK]

Now michael cannot sit. He
can think about his trans-
gression while standing.[BRK]

[POR10]
That certainly is good
news.[BRK]

One day, perhaps i can 
forgive what you once did to
me, but i can never forget.[END]

=== 3f | 1bb4a | 55 ===
[POR16]
Jean your life will only
be limited by what you can
dream.[BRK]

Remember that always...[END]

I'm a member of the blue
dragon cult.[BRK]

I live for combat.[BRK]

I pine for sweat.[BRK]

I thirst for blood.[BRK]

I am the ultimate killing
machine.[BRK]

But on the weekends, i'm an
althena-fearing guy.[END]

many of these fights.[BRK]

The thrill of the kill has
diminished, lately.[END]

I'm going to make my next 
opponent wish he was dead.[BRK]

Just when he's beggin' for
mercy, i'm gonna dig into

Crud! Crap! Poop! I lost!
I can't believe i lost!
Crap! Craaap![BRK]

[POR02]
Kinda a baby-man vocabulary
for such a cold-hearted
killer, don't you think?[BRK]

[POR10]
Well, this is rated 'k-a,'
you know.[END]

=== 45 | 1bede | 5f ===
No...way! I don't believe
it![BRK]

We've never lost. Lunn told
us we were invincible![BRK]

This can't be![END]

=== 46 | 1bf50 | 8e ===
Master lunn has banned blue
dragon karate...[BRK]

...and especially the black
karate of death.[BRK]

In fact, just the mention
of these can get me caned![END]

=== 47 | 1bfee | 90 ===
Master lunn is teaching us
a new karate style.[BRK]

Blu...well, that old kind of
karate is no longer
practiced here.[BRK]

We're kindler, gentler
warriors![END]

=== 48 | 1c08e | eb ===
Ha! You think you guys 
are going to win? [BRK]

Don't kid yourselves.[BRK]

We've been practicing night
and day for as long as I
can recall.[BRK]

And we're trained to show
no mercy to the fools that
oppose us.[BRK]

Only an idiot would face us
in the ring.
[END]

=== 49 | 1c18c | 91 ===
Don't worry. When we fight,
i'll try to go easy on you.[BRK]

I'll tear your aorta out

Consider that a guarantee.
If i were you, i'd quit now.[END]

=== 4a | 1c230 | 54 ===
You're our next opponent?[BRK]

Ha ha ha ha![BRK]

Aahhhh ha ha ha ha ha![BRK]

You're kidding, right?[END]

=== 4b | 1c298 | 60 ===
Now that you've beaten all
the others, lunn is all that
remains.[BRK]

Fool! You don't stand a
chance![END]

=== 4c | 1c30c | 89 ===
Curse lunn! I can't believe
he lost to...to...to a 
stupid girl.[BRK]

Girls are stupid.[BRK]

Only boys should fight.[BRK]

I hate girls.[BRK]

They're so dumb.[END]

=== 4d | 1c3a4 | 9a ===
Ban all girls from sports.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Ban all girls from sports![BRK]

Now i can't beat people
up and rip out entrails,
thanks to you, jean![BRK]

I hate you so much![END]

=== 4e | 1c44e | ec ===
This is the best tournament!
I can't believe we get to
beat people up![BRK]

And what's better, is that
these cretins are no match
for our superior skill![BRK]

Like little lambs to the
slaughter...he he he he...[BRK]

We're number one!
We're number one![END]

=== 4f | 1c54e | 8b ===
The time has come for all
to fear the power of blue
dragon karate.[BRK]

I'm gonna make mincemeat
outta my opponents! And...[BRK]

...i love mincemeat.[END]

=== 50 | 1c5ec | a7 ===
There is no one that can
match the superiority of
our fighting skill.[BRK]

This tournament is a joke![BRK]

They should just hand over
the trophy and admit that
we are the best!
[END]

=== 51 | 1c6aa | b8 ===
There's no way that a girl
defeated the masters of blue
dragon karate![BRK]

I refuse to admit it![BRK]

It wasn't a girl it was a
guy in drag! I know it![BRK]

I saw those hairy pits![BRK]

Cheater! Cheater![END]

=== 52 | 1c77e | 60 ===
I know...it's a dream...
yeah, this is a dream...[BRK]

No, not a dream...[BRK]

.............a nightmare!

[END]

=== 53 | 1c7f2 | 86 ===
I still won't believe that
lunn was defeated by a 
girl.[BRK]

This has to be some kind
of cruel joke![BRK]

Someone, please tell me 
it's a joke![END]

=== 54 | 1c888 | 89 ===
After lunn slapped me a few
times, i realized how silly
i was acting.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

But i still say girls
should be banned from all
sports!
[END]

=== 55 | 1c920 | 78 ===
This competition is as good
as ours right now.[BRK]

We've trained hard for the
last week.[BRK]

The coach even made us do
push-ups![END]

=== 56 | 1c9ac | d6 ===
We've failed! Our training
wasn't good enough![BRK]

I think that we should start
training one month before
the tournament next year.[BRK]

[POR02]
Ooooh! A whole month before
the tournament?[BRK]

That'll make a big
difference......not![END]

=== 57 | 1ca96 | 13f ===
You guys are actually quite
strong![BRK]

I was amazed at how quickly
you put us away.[BRK]

How do you train?[BRK]

Do you get into bar fights
to practice?[BRK]

You gotta have some killer
regimen to have defeated us![BRK]

[POR02]
No, you just suck.[BRK]

Plain and simple.[BRK]

It's really quite pathetic,
actually.[BRK]

Your wives must be really,
really embarrassed.[END]

=== 58 | 1cbe4 | c5 ===
I'm going to become strong
like you. Then i can save
this world.[BRK]

What should i do first to
get into shape?[BRK]

[POR02]
I'd recommend losing the
beer gut...[BRK]

Then, you might want to
try looking for a spine...[END]

=== 59 | 1ccb8 | 6e ===
Hey! You guys look like a
buncha silk-panty weaklings.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

I thought they stopped 
fixing these fights.[END]

=== 5a | 1cd3a | 67 ===
Whew![BRK]

I didn't think that you 
guys were that tough![BRK]

You sure as hell didn't 
look like karate masters![END]

=== 5b | 1cdb4 | 43 ===
Oh man! At the next
tournament you're gonna pay![BRK]

Man, will you pay![END]

=== 5c | 1ce06 | 99 ===
You think you're so tough![BRK]

You come here, beat up a
couple of us, and all of
the sudden you're the best![BRK]

Well, i got news for ya!
You're not. Nyah, nyah![END]

=== 5d | 1ceb2 | 112 ===
Our form of karate is 
called virtual assassin
karate.[BRK]

We're trained by advanced
virtual technology.[BRK]

I know we're going to win.
We've trained too hard to
lose now.[BRK]

Besides, the money you get
for winning is worth getting
your brains kicked in.[BRK]

[POR05]
Do you guys have a promoter?[END]

=== 5e | 1cfdc | 73 ===
We're using virtual reality
to train.[BRK]

It's prepared us for this
tournament, and we didn't
even have to go to a gym![END]

=== 5f | 1d062 | 66 ===
Crap! We invested so much
in technology, and now look!
We lost![BRK]

Curse you, technology. Curse
you!




[END]

=== 60 | 1d0dc | 95 ===
I knew we should have 
practiced on real people.[BRK]

But our stupid programmer
assured us that the virtual
opponents were tough enough.[BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Liar!
[END]

=== 61 | 1d180 | 13c ===
You guys won first place in
the tournament? I don't 
believe it!![BRK]

Say, do you think you could
write a book on your 
fighting techniques?[BRK]

Or, better yet, why don't
you train us? We could use
that cat for practice!![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh yeah?? I'd like to see
you try that, buster![BRK]

I can take you with both
wings tied behind my back![END]

=== 62 | 1d2cc | 9e ===
We are members of the bunny
karate dojo.[BRK]

It's basically made up of 
bored housewives who love to
beat the snot out of men.[BRK]

Our motto is 'sniff, sniff,
snarf!'[END]

=== 63 | 1d37e | 90 ===
Wow! You won, too? 
No one thought that we
would even win one match.[BRK]

But we showed everyone![BRK]

We made it to the next
round![BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf!
[END]

=== 64 | 1d422 | fc ===
The guys from the blue 
dragon karate didn't even
care that we were girls![BRK]

I even wore the tight outfit
we designed to distract
opponents![BRK]

He didn't even blink twice!
He just moved in for the
kill.[BRK]

I don't think they're even
human![BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![END]

=== 65 | 1d536 | b9 ===
You guys are, like, totally
buff.[BRK]

But i can't believe you're
winning dressed like that![BRK]

Jean, don't you know that
green is out this season?[BRK]

A definite fashion 'no!'[BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![END]

=== 66 | 1d60a | a5 ===
Some say it's just an honor 
to be invited to the
competition,[BRK]

and that it doesn't matter
if you win or lose.[BRK]

Liars!!! I really wanted to 
win!![BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![END]

=== 67 | 1d6be | d6 ===
At next year's competition,
we are going to win first
place if it kills us!![BRK]

We're practicing a new 
karate technique.[BRK]

It's called the high-leg,
double-flip, half-twist
knee to the groin. [BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf!




[END]

=== 68 | 1d7a8 | c3 ===
The secret of bunny karate 
is to stun your male 
opponent with your beauty.[BRK]

Once they have become 
fixated on you, they'll
let you beat them up.[BRK]

Some even say they enjoy
it.[BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![END]

=== 69 | 1d882 | 86 ===
What? You're in this 
competition, too? Oh no,
i just told you our secret![BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![BRK]

[POR10]
Don't worry, i'm not 
impressed...
[END]

=== 6a | 1d91c | dc ===
Due to very strict regimens,
many of the men here have
never even seen a girl.[BRK]

That's why they don't know
what to do when we fight
them. It's an easy win.[BRK]

Our curves turn 'em on,
and we turn 'em out![BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![END]

=== 6b | 1da0c | df ===
I can't believe we lost.
We did everything right...[BRK]

...tight outfits, athletic
jumping kicks, coquettish
winks, strategic melvins...[BRK]

Those guys didn't fall for
any of it! In fact, they
nearly killed us![BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![END]

=== 6c | 1db02 | 82 ===
We're always looking for new
members to join the
bunny karate dojo.[BRK]

Say, goldilocks, do you
want to join us?[BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf!
[END]

[POR07]
Geez, you'd have to pay
me a ton of silver to
dress like that.[END]

=== 6e | 1dbe0 | bb ===
[POR05]
I'd pay you to dress 
like that.[BRK]

[POR07]
I should have expected a
comment like that from you,
ronfar![BRK]

[POR02]
Don't be so uptight, lemina.
I'd pay to see you dress
like that, too.[BRK]

He he he he...[END]

=== 6f | 1dcb6 | c6 ===
I'm sorry, but i think
next year we're going
to have designer clothes.[BRK]

We need a little more of
a 'distraction factor.'[BRK]

I'm thinking we need to
go the pasties and thong
route...[BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![END]

=== 70 | 1dd8c | 74 ===
I think i'm gonna give this
fighting thing up.[BRK]

I really picture myself as
more of a director...[BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![END]

=== 71 | 1de14 | ed ===
Soon bunny karate will
become the most feared
karate in the world![BRK]

Men will soon learn that
women have the power to
rule their lives.[BRK]

And if they disagree with 
us, pow!! Right in the 
kisser![BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![BRK]

[POR02]
You said it, sister![END]

=== 72 | 1df18 | fa ===
If we win this competition,
people will finally sit up
and take notice of us.[BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![BRK]

[POR02]
Oh, with those outfits, I
think you already have them
standing at attention![BRK]

They're probably waiting
to give you a twenty-one
gun salute right now![END]

=== 73 | 1e026 | 7c ===
Look at that guy over there.
He's such a hunk!![BRK]

I can't wait to fight him.[BRK]

I'm gonna hurt him so bad...[BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![END]

=== 74 | 1e0b6 | 71 ===
Those blue dragon guys were
too serious! They scared me.[BRK]

Their eyes look so...so...
...dead![BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![END]

=== 75 | 1e13e | 72 ===
You guys totally kicked some
major butt today![BRK]

Say, jean, do you think
you'd want to join us?[BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![END]

[POR10]
I'm sorry, there's no way I
could dress like that.[END]

[POR08]
Jean, these clothes look
somewhat like your dancing
attire...[BRK]

What is wrong with that?[END]

I still think you should
consider my offer and join
us.[BRK]

Sniff, sniff, snarf![END]

=== 79 | 1e2d4 | 69 ===
Wait until you see next 
year's costumes.[BRK]

We're sure to win that 
competition without lifting
one finger.[END]

Have you changed your mind?
I knew you would...[BRK]

In fact, i've already
ordered a costume for you![BRK]

[POR10]
I don't think so...[BRK]

[POR02]
Come on, jean! I think you'd
look cute in that outfit.[BRK]

A little fuzzy bunny tail
on your posterior would be
so cute![BRK]

He he he...

We are the wolf karate
team.[BRK]

We act like crazy, wild 
animals and bite our
opponents to death.[BRK]

Ahhhhh...bite me!

Stand back, or i'll bite
you to death!!![END]

Are you our next opponent?[BRK]

Good. I hope you're ready to
lose![END]

I hate you! Why...why...
couldn't you let us win?[BRK]

Now our dojo has been
dishonored![BRK]

You may act like an animal,
but you still cry like a
baby![END]

We've already begun to
train for next year.[BRK]

With our new werewolf
attack, there's no way
we can lose![END]

Hey you, why don't you
join us?[BRK]

You look like you've got
a pretty good set of fangs
on ya![END]

=== 81 | 1e6fe | 61 ===
[POR09]
I'm sorry, i will only
participate in a fair
fight.[BRK]

Biting is not an honorable
way to victory.[END]

=== 82 | 1e772 | 74 ===
I've had my fangs enlarged.
Now i'll be able to bite
my victims on the neck.[BRK]

I'm now favored to win all
my matches!![END]

[POR05]
Care to make a little
wager on that?[END]

Guess what!? You're my next
opponents.[BRK]

Check out these fangs, and
quake with fear.[END]

I'm not scared of any of
you![BRK]

You're going to curse the

You don't stand a chance

Pansy-wuss-losers![END]

Humans will never possess

Next year we will not lose,
for our training will be
very hard.[BRK]

We will fight with wild 
dogs...[BRK]

We will spar with ferocious
kittens...[BRK]

We will hog-tie hamsters...[BRK]

We will do whatever it takes
to be the best![END]

I think i'm having...[END]

Don't worry. After my heart

But we must win! If we
don't win i'll...i'll
kill myself!!

[END]

=== 8c | 1ebce | 96 ===
My doctor said that i've
gotta stop training so hard.[BRK]

It's not good for my heart.[BRK]

Once my blood pressure 
drops, i'm gonna be right
back in that ring![END]

=== 8d | 1ec78 | 78 ===
The blue dragon cult's bark
is worse than their bite![BRK]

The armadillo dojo will
defeat them without even
breaking a sweat.[END]

=== 8e | 1ed08 | 6c ===
The whole purpose of our
training is to practice
defense.[BRK]

If your opponent can't hit
you, then he can't win.[END]

=== 8f | 1ed88 | 4f ===
Well...now that i think
about it, [BRK]

i guess we should've
practiced how to punch.[END]

=== 90 | 1ede4 | 5d ===
The blue dragon cult still
attacked, even after i threw
in the towel!!![BRK]

They have no honor...[END]

=== 91 | 1ee54 | 47 ===
I really think we should've
concentrated more on 
offensive techniques.[END]

Well, duh! That should've
been part of your training.[BRK]

You looked like a stinkin'
idiot out there![END]

With this steel armor, i'll
roll up into a small ball
so no one can hit me.[BRK]

Then, when they're tired of
hitting me, that's when I
get 'em.[BRK]

[POR10]
With all that armor, why
do you need the sword?[BRK]

[POR00]
What? Oh! That's my custom
back-scratcher.[END]

Offense...[BRK]

Dang, i knew we forgot
about something.

Look at my armor. The blue
dragon guys beat it to bits![BRK]

I don't think i'm cut out
to be an armadillo...[END]

We've decided to go on
strike for better pay.[BRK]

Sure, the fans will be
pissed, but i need somethin'
shiny to put in my wallet.[END]

=== 97 | 1f16a | 74 ===
I hate all this armor.[BRK]

I can barely move.[BRK]

In fact, i don't think i'll
be able to get onto the
mat without some help.[END]

=== 98 | 1f1f2 | 9b ===
I surrendered to the blue
dragon cult and they still
beat the crap out of me.[BRK]

If i were you, i'd be very
afraid.[BRK]

Get out of your match while
you still can.[END]

=== 99 | 1f29a | 2d ===
[POR10]
Don't worry. I've no 
intention of losing.[END]

=== 9a | 1f2d6 | c6 ===
We've decided to eliminate
the heavy steel armor,[BRK]

and go with something like
foam padding. [BRK]

That way our opponents will
never be able to hurt us.[BRK]

I just can't wait to try it
out in real competition![END]

Stay right here. You'll be

What are you talking about?
My face is the proof that

Don't worry. I can't lose.
This is my destiny...

I can't stop you, jean.
I understand your reasons

I just wish i were as strong

stopped lunn, or even
escaped like you did.[BRK]

Hurry, jean! You mustn't be
late for the fight. I know
you'll win.

is only practice.[BRK]

[POR10]
Don't worry. Soon you won't
have to practice at all![BRK]

This inhumane torture of
innocent children will stop![END]

=== b5 | 21e72 | 5d ===
They are beginning to teach 
me the art of assassination.[BRK]

But i don't want to hurt
anyone...
[END]

=== b6 | 21ee6 | 59 ===
What!? I don't have to
practice karate anymore!?[BRK]

Thank the maker! I...i...
love you guys![END]

=== b7 | 21f5a | 53 ===
I don't know how to thank
you for saving me. Just know
that i'm eternally grateful.[END]

=== b8 | 21fbc | 99 ===
Everyone wants me to go to
the town of horam to learn
a new type of karate.[BRK]

Quite frankly, i don't want
to ever see another dojo for
the rest of my life.[END]

=== b9 | 22068 | ef ===
Jean! You're alive!?
I don't believe it![BRK]

They told us you died when
you attempted to escape.[BRK]

They made an example of your
death![BRK]

[POR10]
They had to tell you that.
They knew that if you
learned of my escape,[BRK]

many others would try to
escape too.[END]

=== ba | 2216e | b3 ===
Jean, don't try to fight
the blue dragon cult! 
They'll kill you!![BRK]

It's not worth risking your
life just to save a few 
children.[BRK]

[POR10]
Don't talk like that! Every
life is precious!
[END]

=== bb | 2223c | b4 ===
I just heard of your 
victory![BRK]

Congratulations!![BRK]

This is so grand! I can't
wait to get out of this 
place and go home.[BRK]

I just...i just hope my
parents haven't forgotten
about me...[END]

=== bc | 22310 | b0 ===
The first thing i'm gonna
do when i get home is go
shopping.[BRK]

No, wait, maybe i'll go out
to eat first. No, wait...[BRK]

[POR10]
Don't worry. You'll have 
time to do all of those
things.
[END]

=== bd | 223d8 | 6e ===
Jean always seemed so
dedicated to her practice.[BRK]

Maybe that's why they never
thought she would try to 
escape.[END]

=== be | 22456 | 8b ===
My dream didn't come true.
Jean, i don't have a family
anymore.[BRK]

That's why all of us have 
decided to stay together.
This is my family now.[END]

=== bf | 224ee | 6b ===
[POR10]
I think you all will make
one great, big, happy
family.[BRK]

Maybe we'll rename this
place 'zen walton zone.'[END]

=== c0 | 2256c | d3 ===
I...i...tried...to escape
like...you...jean...[BRK]

They...beat me...so bad...
that...i...don't have...
any...feeling in...my legs.[BRK]

[POR10]
Those bastards will pay for
this![BRK]

Don't worry, kid, i'll beat
them into custard!
[END]

=== c1 | 22656 | 43 ===
Is that...you, jean??[BRK]

Oh no! I think i'm 
beginning to hallucinate![END]

=== c2 | 226b4 | 7d ===
Jean, did you...win one
for...me?[BRK]

I hope you beat the crap
out of them.[BRK]

[POR10]
I did worse than that!
Just wait until you see...
[END]

=== c3 | 22750 | 1e ===
Momma...[BRK]

Momma...is that you?
[END]

=== c4 | 22786 | 6e ===
My health has been restored.
I'm able to move freely.[BRK]

Where's jean? I want so much
to thank you for saving me.[END]

=== c5 | 22804 | 97 ===
I don't think i'll ever
practice karate again.[BRK]

It causes me too much
pain.[BRK]

The physical pain was easy
to get over, but the mental
pain never goes away.[END]

=== c6 | 228ae | d0 ===
This is the room where 
we train our blue dragon
team.[BRK]

...no way!! I don't believe
my eyes. Is that you, jean?[BRK]

[POR10]
Yes. I've come back to stop
the blue dragon cult.[BRK]

You'd better decide where
your loyalty lies.[END]

=== c7 | 22996 | 50 ===
Don't worry, jean. I believe
in you! Now get in there and
kick their blue butts![END]

=== c8 | 22a02 | b7 ===
Jean, you defeated them.
We all owe you our lives.[BRK]

If there's anything that I
can do for you, just let
me know...[BRK]

[POR10]
Please, take care of these
kids. I still have one more
fight left.[END]

=== c9 | 22ad8 | 2b ===
Jean, thank you. We're all
doing fine, now.[END]

=== ca | 22b1a | 92 ===
These kids love me.[BRK]

You know, if you feed 'em
nothing but sugar,[BRK]

they sure get their chores
done quick![BRK]

Little kids are bouncin'
off the walls!


[END]

=== cb | 22bbc | d3 ===
Jean, so many of these kids
look up to you. You've 
become their hero.[BRK]

Some want to continue to
train so that they can 
fight like you.[BRK]

Others want singing and
dancing lessons so that
they can join the carnival.[END]

=== cc | 22c9c | b3 ===
[POR10]
I'm truly honored. Is there
anything i can do to help?[BRK]

[POR00]
Some of them want you to
teach them how to dance.[BRK]

[POR10]
When i finish this little
task, i'll be back and we'll
all dance.[END]

=== cd | 22d54 | f ===
Zen zone dojo 2[END]
