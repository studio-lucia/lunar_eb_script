Hiro, let's head out to
the carnival.[BRK]

It's north of Nota this time
of year...[BRK]

Giban and his troupe are
supposed to be there with
his Magic Arrow.[BRK]

Maybe we can use the Magic
Arrow to fly past Nota.[BRK]

It's really our only shot
at getting past this
roadblock.[END]

=== 1 | c4b6 | 5c ===
Welcome to the trade town
of Nota![BRK]

You'll find virtually any-
thing your heart desires
here.[END]

=== 2 | c526 | 69 ===
Now that the Dragonship
Destiny is no longer
blocking the bridge,[BRK]

we can cross to the other
side of Nota.[END]

=== 3 | c59e | 7e ===
Come, come! The wonders of
our village await the
curious.[BRK]

You can find virtually any-
thing you desire in our
prosperous town![END]

=== 4 | c62a | 34 ===
[POR07]
Anything? Oh pooh! You're
exaggerating, I'm sure![END]

=== 5 | c672 | 15a ===
Hey there, you look a little
pale...perhaps you'd like to
buy some charred newt?[BRK]

It's really quite a safe
and effective stimulant and
health tonic.[BRK]

The only minor side effect
is atomic diarrhea...[BRK]

[POR02]
Atomic diarrhea? Geez, I
wonder how dangerous a
dragon with that would be?[BRK]

Talk about a blast that
lasts! Whooo! I don't want
to think about it...[END]

=== 6 | c7e4 | 88 ===
If I can't interest you in
charred newt, how about
essence of frog's phlegm?[BRK]

It's an aphrodisiac, you
know![BRK]

[POR05]
You don't say...Hmmmm...[END]

=== 7 | c880 | f2 ===
Look at this! It's our
latest shipment of special
tonics.[BRK]

How about some grated kitty
nipple?...Or maybe you'd
prefer fresh ogre wart?[BRK]

[POR02]
I'd prefer that you stop
talking about that stuff,[BRK]

or I'll be giving you a
free jar of hot dragon
spew![END]

=== 8 | c98a | a2 ===
If you ever need strange
or exotic wares, come to
me first...[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, shyeah, I'll write your
address in my book...[BRK]

...under 'freaks I'd prefer
not meeting again.'[END]

=== 9 | ca40 | 6a ===
How about a beautiful life
flower today?[BRK]

C'mon, a beautiful flower
for a beautiful lady...
What do ya say?[END]

=== a | cab8 | b2 ===
[POR07]
I'd rather have a beautiful
1000s coin. Can you arrange
that, too?[BRK]

[POR00]
Girlie, if I were in the
position to throw away
cash on bums,[BRK]

you'd call me Clinton and
I'd be president.[END]

=== b | cb82 | 4b ===
Come on, try my beautiful
flowers. Their scent will
add years to your life![END]

=== c | cbe0 | be ===
I have seen the face of an
angel beautiful in every
respect save one...[BRK]

...She is unadorned with
delicate flowers to
compliment her beauty...[BRK]

Buy my flowers and perfect
your look, won't you?[END]

=== d | ccac | 6a ===
[POR07]
Pooh! What a complete line
of donkey plop![BRK]

I know a good sales job when
I hear one, and that's a
beaut![END]

=== e | cd2e | 12e ===
Show someone special how
much you care for them.[BRK]

Let me send them some of
my beautiful flowers,
won't you?[BRK]

[POR02]
Hrmph! I wish Nall would
take an interest in me
like that.[BRK]

But he just thinks I'm
plain and ugly...[BRK]

Well I'm drinking milk,
and growing...[BRK]

Someday, I'll be strong and
so beautiful...just wait![END]

=== f | ce6c | 7b ===
Goddess Althena fought with
a dark force to save our
world for light...[BRK]

If you're grateful, you can
donate at our shrine...[END]

=== 10 | cefa | 8f ===
I heard that Leo blocked the
bridge to trap a destroyer
in our midst![BRK]

I was so scared! I wonder if
the dark force has come back
to our world?!?[END]

=== 11 | cf9c | 9c ===
Long ago, a dark force came
to claim our land. Goddess
Althena defeated it.[BRK]

It is said that one day,
the destroyer will return to
take light from our world![END]

=== 12 | d048 | 6b ===
If human power can save our
world, why do we need the
shrines?[BRK]

This is a very confusing
time to be alive...[END]

=== 13 | d0c6 | 7e ===
You look like you're new
to the village of Nota.[BRK]

Take my word for it: the
shopkeepers here can rip you
off, so watch yourself![END]

=== 14 | d158 | 8d ===
See! Didn't I tell you! The
shopkeepers ripped you off,
didn't they?[BRK]

I tried to warn you, but
did you listen? Nooooo,
that would be too easy![END]

=== 15 | d1f4 | 62 ===
Now that the Cult has
straightened up, the shop-
keepers have become honest.[BRK]

Can you believe that?[END]

=== 16 | d26a | 13c ===
Hey...hey com'ere![BRK]

Listen, I got the secret
to making tons of money.[BRK]

Come closer and I'll tell
you how to do it.[BRK]

[POR07]
Really? A secret way to
make big money? Spill it![BRK]

[POR00]
Okay, you've got to stare
into my eyes...stare really
hard...[BRK]

[POR07]
Oh...m-my...I seem to...
to...be getting...slee...
py...[BRK]

[POR00]
Hehehehe...sucker...![END]

=== 17 | d408 | 175 ===
Hey there...listen up!
I know how to get to the
west side of Nota...[BRK]

...without having to cross
the bridge...[BRK]

[POR02]
Really? Tell me! We need
to get across in a hurry![BRK]

[POR00]
You'll have to concentrate
on what I'm telling you, so
why not stare into my eyes.[BRK]

That's right...stare hard...[BRK]

[POR02]
<Yawn> I...I feel so very...
...sleepy all of the...s...
...sudden...[BRK]

[POR00]
Hehehehe...sucker![END]

=== 18 | d598 | 14a ===
Pssst! Wanna learn a big
secret about Althena?[BRK]

Come closer and I'll tell
you...[BRK]

[POR02]
Tell me what? What do you
know about Goddess Althena?[BRK]

[POR00]
It's hard for mortals to
understand, so concentrate
by staring into my eyes...[BRK]

[POR02]
Your eyes? But they're...
...making me...so...sleepy.[BRK]

[POR00]
Hehehehehe...like taking
candy from a baby![BRK]

Sucker![END]

=== 19 | d6fa | 101 ===
Hey...Hey you! Com'ere! I
got a big secret you might
be interested in...[BRK]

[POR02]
Ha! I'm not fallin' for
that line again! Forget it,
buster![BRK]

I'm going to teach you the
error of your ways...[BRK]

[POR00]
Oooooowwwww![BRK]

Hey! You burned me, you
maniac! Get...Get away
from me![END]

=== 1a | d80e | 12a ===
My goal in life used to be
ripping off as many people
as I could to get rich.[BRK]

That was wrong, and now I'm
trying to make amends for
what I've done.[BRK]

So look into my eyes, and
I'll tell you a secret I
just learned...[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh, no...thanks. I'll give
you a bit more time to work
on your trustworthiness.[END]

=== 1b | d950 | 13d ===
Remember me? I used to be
a petty thief.[BRK]

But I've seen the error of
my ways. I've been nothing
but honest for months![BRK]

[POR02]
Since we're being honest,
I've got something to share
with you...[BRK]

Your breath smells like
hot dog and cottage cheese
dog vomit.[BRK]

Can you do something about
it? It's really pretty
gross...honestly.[END]

=== 1c | daa0 | 1bc ===
Did you notice that there
are ancient ruins between
Nota and Takkar?[BRK]

It's a very strange place.
I wonder what's there?[BRK]

[POR07]
Maybe it's filled with
mounds of ancient treasure!
Let's go find out![BRK]

[POR05]
Whoa there, little miss!
That place is rumored to be
crawlin' with the undead![BRK]

I certainly don't want to
fight things I can't kill.[BRK]

Especially if they're hell-
bent on killing me![BRK]

I'd say those ancient ruins
are a lose-lose proposition.
I'll pass...[END]

=== 1d | dc74 | 5e ===
I wonder if there is a
hidden way into the ruins?[BRK]

And if there is, is there
a way to get out?[END]

=== 1e | dcea | 62 ===
You got inside the ancient
ruins? I don't believe it![BRK]

W-Was it loaded with price-
less treasures?[END]

=== 1f | dd5a | 77 ===
[POR07]
Pooh! It was nothing like I
expected. I didn't find one
ancient treasure![BRK]

But I guess we did see an
ancient relic...[END]

=== 20 | ddec | 51 ===
You've got to be kidding me!
You mean to say there was
nothing of value in there?[END]

=== 21 | de4a | 37 ===
[POR07]
No kidding! I'm serious. I
wouldn't lie about money![END]

=== 22 | de94 | 71 ===
A few days ago, there was
some guy asking a lot of
questions about the ruins.[BRK]

Which ruins, I don't really
know...[END]

=== 23 | df18 | c7 ===
You were the one asking
about the ruins, weren't
you?[BRK]

Say, did you find any
precious jewels?[BRK]

[POR09]
I don't have time to look
for ancient treasure, you
simpleton.[BRK]

What do you take me for,
a grave robber?[END]

=== 24 | dfee | a4 ===
Nota is a busy trade center.
People come here from all
over to trade goods.[BRK]

I buy goods from this one
and sell it to that one at
a profit.[BRK]

It can be very lucrative.[END]

=== 25 | e0aa | 7d ===
I don't know why Althena's
Guard has blockaded the
town![BRK]

If they don't open the
barrier, the lack of open
trade will kill us![END]

=== 26 | e142 | 91 ===
I couldn't care less about
a destroyer,[BRK]

or whatever excuse they're
using for blockading us![BRK]

Althena's guard must remove
the barrier they've made![END]

=== 27 | e1e6 | 47 ===
Nota is a center for trade.
You can find almost anything
you want here.[END]

=== 28 | e23c | 9a ===
Now that Zophar has been
defeated, the monster
attacks have subsided.[BRK]

Now Nota is even busier with
tradesmen from all over the
world coming to sell wares.[END]

=== 29 | e2e6 | 61 ===
Our village is separated by
a bridge.[BRK]

You can pass to the other
side of Nota by using the
bridge.[END]

=== 2a | e35a | 79 ===
This bridge leads to the
west side of Nota.[BRK]

However, we can't cross now
because Althena's Guard has
it blocked! Idiots...[END]

=== 2b | e3e6 | 7f ===
Now that Althena's Guard
has left Nota, the bridge
is clear once again.[BRK]

The fair people of Nota can
once again trade freely...[END]

=== 2c | e474 | 171 ===
One of the favorite sports
in Nota is not washing for
a whole week,[BRK]

then putting on old clothes
from Seattle and heading to
the middle of the bridge,[BRK]

where you tie a cord around
your ankles, and jump off
the bridge to fly.[BRK]

The cord stops you before
you hit the water, and you
spring high into the air.[BRK]

We call it grungy jumping.[BRK]

[POR02]
That sounds fun! Where do
I sign up??[END]

=== 2d | e5f2 | fe ===
[POR05]
Ruby, you can fly already!
What kind of sport is it
for you?[BRK]

[POR02]
I just like the 'not washing
for a week and wearing old
clothes' part...[BRK]

[POR05]
Figures...I'd have to get
hooked up with a flying
cat that likes grunge...[BRK]

What are the odds of that?
Weirdo...[END]

=== 2e | e704 | 3b ===
Nota is the only place
I come to sell the things
I collect.[END]

=== 2f | e756 | 47 ===
Sometimes I come here to
sell seashells, other times
it's shiny stones.[END]

=== 30 | e7b4 | 4d ===
Most people aren't
interested in the things
I sell.[BRK]

They don't see the art...[END]

=== 31 | e81c | 45 ===
I just brought in a new
shipment of toenail
clippings. Wanna see 'em?[END]

=== 32 | e874 | 4d ===
My toenail clippings make
a great back scratcher if
you glue them to a stick.[END]

=== 33 | e8d0 | 79 ===
Now that the world is at
peace, how about a nice
wad of butt-lint?[BRK]

It's quite rare, and some
say it wards off the undead.[END]

=== 34 | e958 | 3c ===
Like, this town is soooo
boring...Nothing ever
happens here.[END]

=== 35 | e9ac | be ===
Like, did you see that!?
The Dragonship Destiny
is right over there![BRK]

Like, do you know what this
means? Althena is watching
our town personally![BRK]

Like, I think I have to get
my nails done...[END]

=== 36 | ea86 | ba ===
Like, at first I thought it
was, like, cool that
Althena's Guard was here,[BRK]

but now they're just being,
like, annoying hemorrhoids. [BRK]

They're blocking the bridge
to the other side of Nota![END]

=== 37 | eb54 | 77 ===
Like, I wish the Althena
Cult would blow town.[BRK]

They're really getting on 
my nerves, always begging
for, like, money...[END]

=== 38 | ebd8 | 6a ===
[POR07]
Don't you just hate people
like that?[BRK]

Always talking about money,
money, money, money...it's
sickening![END]

=== 39 | ec52 | 7e ===
Like, I'm so relieved I
didn't join the Cult of
Althena![BRK]

They weren't working for
Althena. They were working
to revive Zophar![END]

=== 3a | ecde | d ===
[POR09]
....
.....[END]

=== 3b | ecfa | 83 ===
Hey, hey mister! Do you
know the name of the
Dragonmaster?[BRK]

He's the greatest of the
Four Heroes, and he works
with Althena herself![END]

=== 3c | ed94 | 8d ===
Hey...Hey mister! Can you
get rid of the people
blocking the bridge?[BRK]

My friend lives on the other
side of Nota, and I can't
go play with him![END]

=== 3d | ee3c | 4c ===
If Althena is good, why
are her guards blocking the
only bridge in our town?[END]

=== 3e | ee9c | 95 ===
I want to be just like the
Dragonmaster that saved the
Goddess Althena![BRK]

It would be sooo cool! 
Fighting the bad guys...
living on the edge...Whoa...[END]

=== 3f | ef40 | 9b ===
I heard that the Dragon-
master double-crossed
Zophar![BRK]

Zophar thought he was
working for him, but he
really worked for Althena![BRK]

What a cool guy! Who is he?[END]

=== 40 | efe0 | 9 ===
East Nota[END]

=== 41 | 1020a | 5f ===
[POR02]
W...What the heck???[BRK]

Hiro, look at that! It's
the Dragonship Destiny![BRK]

Let's get out of here![END]

=== 42 | 1026c | 7b ===
[POR09]
Not so fast, little ones.[BRK]

You did well to get this
far, but you'll not escape
my grasp again.[BRK]

Men, restrain our friends.[END]

=== 43 | 102ea | 7c ===
Sir, we've secured the
prisoners. What shall we
do now?[BRK]

[ROR09]
Wait right there. I'll be
right up to inspect our
little 'catch.'[END]

=== 44 | 1036a | 134 ===
[ROR10]
Uh Hiro, is there something
you haven't told me?[BRK]

Why is Lord Leo interested
in us?[BRK]

[ROR07]
Jean, you are so dim at
times...He's obviously
interested in Lucia.[BRK]

[ROR02]
Shut up, Lemina! Do you
want him to hear us?[BRK]

[ROR05]
Okay, kiddies, knock it off!
We've got to get out of this
mess, and fast...[BRK]

Let's make a run for it![END]

=== 45 | 104b4 | c ===
Nota Village[END]

=== 46 | 10eaa | 83 ===
Hey, stranger! If you're
leaving, you'd better be
stocked up on supplies.[BRK]

It's a long and treacherous
mountain road from here.[END]

=== 47 | 10f3c | 9d ===
Ho, traveler! I'm sure you'll
find Nota is the most
convenient town around.[BRK]

We're easy to find and have
everything you could want
in the way of supplies.[END]

=== 48 | 10fec | 4a ===
Yes, yes! Come on in! The
candies in here are filled
with cream and sugar.[END]

=== 49 | 11048 | 11a ===
[POR02]
Oh, Hiro...My mouth is
watering like a river in
spring...Gimmee![BRK]

[POR10]
They do look good...[BRK]

[POR05]
Uh, uh, uh! Watch it, gals.
Those candies will make
you fat.[BRK]

Nothing repels guys faster
than a fat chick.[BRK]

[POR02]
I don't care, you rude dog!
Hiro, can we go in and just
try one?...Pleaaase?[END]

=== 4a | 1117a | db ===
Come on in...come on in!
Our candies are the sweetest
in the known world![BRK]

[POR02]
Ohhhh, Hiro...Look at those
candies! Did I say I wanted
one?[BRK]

Uh, I meant one...hundred!
Yeah...I'd like a hundred of
these wonderful candies![END]

=== 4b | 11268 | d0 ===
Bite into one of these
sweet, juicy confections,
and you'll never go back![BRK]

Each one is a hand-crafted
masterpiece of sensory
perfection.[BRK]

[POR02]
Ouhhhh! I'm dying to try
these things! Look, I'm
drooling puddles...[END]

=== 4c | 11350 | ba ===
Come...come! Taste a little
piece of heaven. We've made
it just for you.[BRK]

Candies beyond your wildest
dreams...[BRK]

[POR02]
Ouuuuuhhh! I've just got to
have some! Fat or no fat, I
want some candy![END]

=== 4d | 1141e | f1 ===
Hey, hey, hey! Look at my
unique toys! Each is one-
of-a-kind![BRK]

Look...look here! Try this
one! [BRK]

It's a maximizer monster
doll. Put it in water and
it grows 20 times bigger![BRK]

Cool, isn't it?[BRK]

[POR02]
I think it looks kinda
disgusting, if you ask me.[END]

=== 4e | 11526 | 5c ===
Take a look at this toy![BRK]

It's a octopus that grows
30 times larger when you
put it in water![END]

=== 4f | 11592 | e0 ===
Oh, and this one is one
of my favorites! It's a
Dark God Zophar doll.[BRK]

Put it in water and it
grows 100 times it's
normal size![BRK]

Isn't that the coolest
thing you've ever heard?[BRK]

[POR02]
Uh...Get that thing away
from me, you freak![END]

=== 50 | 11686 | 100 ===
Say there, miss. Can I
interest you in a tube of
lipstick made from fish?[BRK]

The rare fish oils will make
your lips silky-smooth, and
the smell is not that bad.[BRK]

[POR02]
Whew! Don't tell me 'not
that bad', lady! I can smell
that crap from here![BRK]

Get it away from me![END]

=== 51 | 11794 | 118 ===
[POR07]
Excuse me, Ruby, but I don't
think she was talking to
you.[BRK]

She said 'lady', not 'kitty-
kitty.' She was obviously
talking to me.[BRK]

[POR02]
I may not be human, but I
am still a lady! Gimme that
lipstick![BRK]

I'll show you how beautiful
I can look, even if it makes
me smell like a cannery.[END]

=== 52 | 118c4 | 9a ===
Beautiful ladies should do
everything they can to
accent their beauty.[BRK]

Why not try our fabulous
fish-oil lipstick?[BRK]

Your man will thank you
in the morning.[END]

=== 53 | 1196c | 98 ===
[POR02]
Is that before or after he
finishes heaving from the
smell of the lipstick?[BRK]

[POR07]
Oh, Ruby! You obviously
aren't mature enough for
this sort of product![END]

=== 54 | 11a14 | 8c ===
In times of peace, ladies
who accent their beauty can
achieve anything.[BRK]

Try our luscious new lip
moisturizer and color-
enhancer, won't you?[END]

=== 55 | 11ab4 | 93 ===
Get'chor boar head rolls!
C'mon, get'chor boar head
rolls here![BRK]

These're the most flavorful
rolls you'll ever taste, and
they're good for you, too![END]

=== 56 | 11b5e | 3e ===
Eat these special boar head
rolls and become a strong
warrior![END]

=== 57 | 11bac | ad ===
If you eat these rolls like
Hiro the famous warrior did,
you'll be just like him![BRK]

And you can only buy 'em
right here![BRK]

[POR02]
...Uh...Hiro...W-We didn't
eat those...did we?[END]

=== 58 | 11c66 | 61 ===
[POR09]
Ough! Just the sight of
those pig-brain creations
makes me ill.[BRK]

How can anyone eat that
tripe?[END]

=== 59 | 11cda | ec ===
Get your scale model of the
Dragonship Destiny right
here![BRK]

If you act right now, I'll
throw in a true scale model
of Lord Leo![BRK]

Say...uh, just between you
and me...[BRK]

I'm overstocked on these
things since most people
don't like Lord Leo.[END]

=== 5a | 11dde | 6b ===
Care to take a few Destiny
models off my hands?[BRK]

I'll throw in a Mauri
action figure with the kung-
fu grip![END]

=== 5b | 11e56 | 87 ===
[POR05]
What a silly-looking doll![BRK]

He obviously just put
Mauri's head on G.I. Joe's
body![BRK]

That's the oldest trick in
the book![BRK]

...I love it![END]

=== 5c | 11eec | 92 ===
Hurry and get your very
own scale model of the
Dragonship Destiny![BRK]

Just like the one that Hiro
used to save the world![BRK]

Hurry, they're going fast![END]

=== 5d | 11f8c | 2b ===
[POR09]
...Mmmm...How much did you
want for one?[END]

=== 5e | 11fca | 65 ===
My dad said I can't have a
Dragonship Destiny model,
'cuz Leo's a pig.[BRK]

Why doesn't he like Lord
Leo?[END]

=== 5f | 12042 | 2a ===
I want a Mauri doll with the
kung-fu grip![END]

=== 60 | 1207a | ae ===
[POR05]
You watch...That kid'll get
his Mauri doll,[BRK]

and the first thing he'll
do is check under the hood.[BRK]

Curious little guy![BRK]

He's on his way to becoming
a real man, just like me![END]

=== 61 | 1213c | 79 ===
My dad got the model of the
Destiny for me![BRK]

I can't believe I have a
scale model of the ship that
saved the world! Yaaaa![END]

=== 62 | 121c8 | 8c ===
I was headed north to the
village of Zulan to trade,
but the road's snowed over.[BRK]

How am I supposed to make a
living, huh? Just tell me,
man![END]

=== 63 | 1226a | 8b ===
[POR02]
I heard that the road to
Zulan was an easy one, even
with snow.[BRK]

[POR00]
You're kidding, right? You
mean to tell me I turned
back for nothing?[END]

=== 64 | 12310 | 3d ===
I was going to Zulan, but
the blizzard conditions
stopped me.[END]

=== 65 | 12364 | 4c ===
I'd be a much more efficient
trapper if I didn't have
this damned arthritis.[END]

=== 66 | 123c0 | 84 ===
I gave up being a trapper,
and I've decided to become
a reporter.[BRK]

Say, did you hear the story
of Hiro, the guy that saved
the world?[END]

=== 67 | 12452 | cc ===
[POR07]
Pardon me, but it seems that
your information is quite
old.[BRK]

If you're going to be a
decent reporter, you have
to get hot stories![BRK]

I'll give you all the hot
stories you want...but it'll
cost you plenty![END]

=== 68 | 12532 | a8 ===
At least there's no noisy
Althena Sanctuary in our
part of Nota![BRK]

Fortunately, all we have is
a lone statue.[BRK]

When you're tired, you can
touch it and it will refresh
you.[END]

=== 69 | 125f2 | 7a ===
We have no sanctuary here
in Nota, but there is a
statue...[BRK]

If your energy gets low,
go touch it to refresh your
strength.[END]

=== 6a | 1267c | 9e ===
It seems like things have
quieted down at the
sanctuary across the bridge.[BRK]

The priests even seem less
weird. It makes me wonder if
I should start going again.[END]

=== 6b | 1272e | b0 ===
I heard that Althena's White
Knight and a destroyer are
staying in Nota.[BRK]

If that's true, it's gonna
put Nota on the map![BRK]

Can you imagine what kind of
battle they're gonna have?[END]

=== 6c | 127f6 | 4a ===
If the Goddess Althena comes
to assist Lord Leo, that
will be even better![END]

=== 6d | 1284e | 7 ===
[POR07]
Yep.[END]

=== 6e | 12864 | 4d ===
Now that Zophar has dis-
appeared, trade should start
picking up around here![END]

=== 6f | 128c4 | 59 ===
I've heard that White Knight
Leo is a very rude and
selfish man.[BRK]

I wonder if it's true...[END]

=== 70 | 1292a | 4b ===
[POR05]
Leo's not a bad guy. You
just have to get to know
him to understand him.[END]

=== 71 | 1298c | 7d ===
I don't care if Lord Leo
is Althena's White Knight,[BRK]

he shouldn't be getting us
humans involved in things
we don't understand![END]

=== 72 | 12a1c | 89 ===
I heard that the coming of
the destroyer was commanded
by Althena herself![BRK]

It doesn't make any sense!
Why would she do a thing
like that?[END]

=== 73 | 12ab4 | 97 ===
The members of Althena's
Cult are just intolerable![BRK]

Noise, noise, noise! That's
all they ever make over in
their sanctuary![BRK]

I'm sick of the lot of 'em![END]

=== 74 | 12b5e | bb ===
[POR05]
After we leave Nota, we
should head north, Hiro.[BRK]

It's a pretty good stretch
to Azado, but I think we
can make it.[BRK]

Since Azado is a port town,
we can take off from there
for Pentagulia.[END]

West Nota[END]

=== 76 | 13fb0 | 44 ===
Since the roads around here
have become dangerous, Nota
is isolated.[END]

=== 77 | 14004 | b1 ===
I have the finest pastas
from across the land.[BRK]

But I've run out of wines
to go with them and I'm too
afraid to get more.[BRK]

I can't sell the pasta
without wine! What am I
gonna do?[END]

=== 78 | 140c8 | 7c ===
I just wish that I could
get a crate of vintage Nota
wine from the warehouse.[BRK]

But the blockade has made
that impossible now![END]

=== 79 | 14160 | 94 ===
I'm still trying to think of
a way to get that case of
wine from the warehouse.[BRK]

If I can sell wine with my
pasta, I'm certain business
will improve![END]

=== 7a | 14210 | 4c ===
What? You got the wine
from the warehouse?[BRK]

[0xB][0][0xE]Gave the wine to the
merchant.[END]

=== 7b | 1426a | 90 ===
I can't believe that you
went to the trouble of
getting this wine![BRK]

Here, take this receipt to
show that I received the
wine.[BRK]

[0xB][0][0xF]Got the receipt.[END]

=== 7c | 14320 | 6e ===
That receipt is proof that
I received the wine. Don't
lose it now![BRK]

Take it back and collect
your delivery fee![END]

=== 7d | 1439e | d6 ===
Well, hello again![BRK]

Say, I got to thinking about
what you did for me and I
thought of this...[BRK]

I think I'm going to rename
the red wine 'Hiro's Special
Reserve' in your honor![BRK]

What do you think? Is that
neat or what?[END]

=== 7e | 14484 | 50 ===
What? Well, whatever you
need, you'd better talk to
my husband. He can help you.[END]

=== 7f | 144e4 | 9e ===
Being the wife of a merchant
is not an easy life.[BRK]

Oh, sure, we have all the
expensive creature comforts,[BRK]

but the nights are awful
cold when my husband's away.[END]

=== 80 | 14596 | 84 ===
My dad is going to be the
best merchant in the whole
wide world![BRK]

Pretty soon, his store will
even be bigger than the one
in Meribia![END]

=== 81 | 14628 | 44 ===
[POR07]
Well now, that's quite a
boast. The store in Meribia
is gigantic![END]

=== 82 | 14684 | be ===
It's cool that Dad is the
biggest merchant in Nota,[BRK]

but I wish he'd stay home
more often. I miss him when
he's on the road.[BRK]

...Uh, don't tell him I said
that, okay? He'd just call
me weak...[END]

=== 83 | 14752 | 64 ===
If my dad's plan goes
through, he'll be able to
stay in Nota all the time![BRK]

I sure hope that happens![END]

=== 84 | 147c4 | 76 ===
[POR02]
Call me daffy, call me
a hopeless sentimental, I
think everything'll be OK.[BRK]

Besides...I looked ahead

Man! I thought I'd never
get back from across the
bridge![BRK]

I crossed over okay, but
when I returned, the bridge
was closed![BRK]

Oh, well, I'm home now. But
for a while there, I was
wondering...[END]

=== 87 | 14fcc | 16 ===
Ahhh! Home sweet home![END]

Say! Aren't you the ones
I met a while ago?[BRK]

Where's the good-looking
girl that was with you?[BRK]

=== 89 | 15070 | 83 ===
The big ship came to Nota
and blocked our bridge.[BRK]

I'm sure it was the work
of those kooks in the shrine
of Althena.[BRK]

Lousy freaks...[END]

=== 8a | 1510a | 76 ===
Did you hear about the
trouble my husband had?[BRK]

I don't understand how
Althena can allow this to
happen to her world...[END]

I like making them for him.[END]

East of the village, they

Opportunists is what those
scoundrels over there are![END]

=== 8e | 15950 | 95 ===
Those kooks from the shrine
paraded through town lookin'
for donations yesterday.[BRK]

I don't know why anyone
would give those noise-
makin' nuts a dime![END]

=== 8f | 159f8 | 93 ===
Since the shrine kooks
stopped parading through
town it's been quiet here.[BRK]

Actually, I kinda got used
to the noise. It feels weird
here without it.[END]

=== 90 | 15a9e | 8c ===
My brother complains about
everything here, including
the high prices.[BRK]

But since he isn't moving,
I'm pretty sure he just
likes to complain.[END]

=== 91 | 15b38 | 91 ===
[POR07]
If the cost of living is
a concern, why not move
to Vane?[BRK]

I can get you into a rent-
controlled apartment...[BRK]

...for a finder's fee, of
course.[END]

=== 92 | 15be0 | 95 ===
Pay no attention to my
brother. He's just a big,
long-winded complainer.[BRK]

He likes to hear the sound
of his own voice. Kinda
like that 'Rush' fella...[END]

=== 93 | 15c84 | 72 ===
It's hard to make a living
here because prices are so
high.[BRK]

I've actually thought about
moving to Meribia lately.[END]

=== 94 | 15d04 | a3 ===
[POR07]
Well, I can tell you that
you'd be much happier in the
historical town of Vane.[BRK]

The members of Althena's

end of our world.[END]

Ya know, that stuff in Zulan

There's probably nothing

Say, I'm glad to hear that
Zulan's problems got solved,[BRK]

but ya know, that was just
a small taste of the weird
happenings 'round here.[END]

I heard a legend that humans
once saved the world for the
Goddess Althena.[BRK]

Do you think that can be
true?[END]

Yeah, those cross-dressin'
nuts want us to join their
cult to save our souls![BRK]

Paaaah! Rubbish![BRK]

If the world is endin', the
world is endin', and there
ain't nothin' humans can do.[END]

It's a rumor, but there's
something to it, ya know.[BRK]

I had to dodge quite a few
monsters to get to Nota

And cold! Whooo! It was the
coldest I've ever seen it!
...Somethin's up.[END]

[POR10]
I wonder if Ghaleon has
anything to do with this?[END]

=== 9d | 168ca | 91 ===
Well, legend or no, at
least those Althena Cult
freaks cleaned up their act.[BRK]

I'm beginning to think the
Goddess had a hand in
cleanin' things up![END]

=== 9e | 1696e | 111 ===
There's nothing quite like
having a drink at the local

You wanna be where you can
see your troubles are all,

The brew here tastes just
a little bit better in the

Don't you think?[END]

You know, since Nota is a
central trading point,[BRK]

tradesmen come from all over
the world and bring their
rumors with them.[BRK]

So Nota has become a sort
of giant rumor mill.[BRK]

For example, I just heard
the Goddess Althena the Cult
members serve is not real![BRK]

Can you believe that? Though
you know...that would
explain a lot of things...[END]

You can't take all the
rumors you hear in Nota 
seriously, you know...[END]

Act right now and if you
buy 3, I'll throw in an
extra bag free![BRK]

Free! Geez! Gimme some of
that stuff![BRK]

...Uh, hehe...Can I pay

Sure...If I can deliver
later, too...[BRK]

Sorry, babe. No freeloaders![END]

Well then, where's my 20%
cut?[BRK]

[POR00]
You know, that's kind of an
ineffective way to ask for
something.[BRK]

I'm sure you can do better.[BRK]

Why don't you work on that
and come back once you've
cleaned it up...[END]

Sorry, we're sold out of

You idiot! I don't want any
snack mix now! I want my

And I will be back for it![END]

Ha! At last we've caught
you, destroyer![BRK]

You thought your clever
girlish disguise would
throw me off,[BRK]

on to your game. This is
the end for you![END]

=== d9 | 1a36c | f6 ===
Don't even think about
running away! I'd find
you...You're mine![BRK]

I will die before I let
you ruin the world that
Althena has built![BRK]

I will capture you for
the glory of Lord Leo![BRK]

C'mon, Hiro! What're you
doing? We've got to make
a break for it![END]

=== da | 1a47a | 2a4 ===
[POR10]
It looks like we really
have no choice, then.[BRK]

We're going to have to
go to the carnival and
try Bulgy's Magic Arrow.[BRK]

It's the only way we're
going to get past Nota
and Lord Leo.[BRK]

[POR02]
The carnival? That sounds
like fun! ...How does the
Magic Arrow work?[BRK]

[POR05]
It's probably better you
don't know.[BRK]

Pardon the obvious pun,
but it sounds like our only
shot at escape...[BRK]

[POR08]
C-Carnival? What is a
carnival? Have I seen one?[BRK]

[POR07]
Honestly, Lucia. Sometimes
I am just amazed at how
shallow your knowledge is![BRK]

If you pay me, I'll tell
you all about carnivals.[BRK]

[POR10]
Knock it off, Lemina! This
is no time for games![BRK]

The carnival is on the north
part of the Madoria Plains.
We'd better move...[END]

Welcome to the shrine of
Great Goddess Althena![BRK]

Our shrine is smaller than
ones in neighboring towns,[BRK]

but what we don't have in
size, we make up for in
zeal![END]

If we keep receiving steady
donations, we'll be able to
expand the shrine.[BRK]

Ohh, how I look forward to
that day![END]

The wicked ones who sought

For all our sake, they must

We're planning our fund-

If we collect enough

Biggest, hmmm? I really
think you're missing the
whole point of service...[END]

With time, effort, and 
money, we'll have the
biggest shrine anywhere![END]

I believe that the power
of the human spirit is
truly amazing.[BRK]

Althena herself could not
have accomplished what you
did any better![END]

The village of Nota will
have the biggest shrine
to Goddess Althena...[BRK]

...even if collecting the
funds we need kills me![END]

=== e4 | 1b218 | 137 ===
This used to be my house
until I gave it to the
priests of the shrine.[BRK]

Now it's a gift to the
service of Althena.[BRK]

I guess I'm what you'd call
a true believer.[BRK]

[POR07]
True sucker is more like it!
You mean to say that you got
nothing for this house?[BRK]

I can't even imagine what
could have been going
through your mind![END]

=== e5 | 1b366 | 5b ===
My house has become a shrine
to the Goddess Althena.[BRK]

I can't imagine a better use
for it...[END]

=== e6 | 1b3d4 | 73 ===
If we do build a large
shrine to the Goddess,[BRK]

this house will become a
hotel for true believers
who come from afar.[END]

[POR07]
Well, now you're talking my
language! If you need a
person to run the hotel,[BRK]

then I'm definitely your
girl! I know I can turn it
into a big moneymaker![END]

=== e8 | 1b4fe | 80 ===
Since we've stopped strong-
arming the people for
donations,[BRK]

we've received very little.
Our big, new shrine may have
to wait...[END]

We are working hard, casting
away worldly desires to
collect more money.[BRK]

We need the money to build
a big shrine to the Goddess.[END]

[POR07]
Hmmm...Well, I can relate to
the money collection thing.[BRK]

I just don't get the part
where you hand it all over
to someone else...[BRK]

Why do you do that again?[END]

=== eb | 1b6d0 | 99 ===
One day we will have the
biggest, most beautiful
shrine in the world.[BRK]

All we have to do is believe
in our collection ability
and hope in Althena's mercy.[END]

=== ec | 1b778 | 93 ===
I used to think that all
that mattered was making
our big shrine.[BRK]

Now I know that we should
concentrate on spreading the
true teachings of Althena.[END]

Isn't this the most tranquil
place you've ever seen? 
[0x5]Well...I guess so.
I don't think so.[END]

Welcome to the shrine of
Althena! We are always open

Ah, child. I understand your
concern, but I assure you
that I have changed.[BRK]

[POR02]
Then why is your hand out?[BRK]

Huh? Huh? Tell me, man!
My life is in ruins, and I

I've got one word for you.[BRK]

Lithium. Look it up.[END]

Have you come here to

I come here every payday to

I heard through the grape-
vine that your kitty is
not a cat at all.[BRK]

In fact, I heard that she's
really a baby Red Dragon![BRK]

If that's true, I'll give
you everything I own to
buy her! What do you think?[BRK]

I think your brain must be

Be careful, though. If you

Those stinkin' cult members
are just way too noisy![BRK]

I wonder if Althena would
approve?[END]

I heard that the Dragonship
Destiny was destroyed by
lightning from heaven![BRK]

I wonder if that's a sign
from Althena...[END]

It seems like the Priesthood
of Althena has changed for
the better recently.[BRK]

They're less noisy and
annoying, preaching a

message Althena wants us to
hear...[END]

donate to Althena...[BRK]

But if Althena lives in our
heart, then why should we
give money to them?![END]
