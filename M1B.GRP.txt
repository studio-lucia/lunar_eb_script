Pooh! This isn't Vane!
Vane is north of here![BRK]

Come on, let's get going.[BRK]

This town is nothing
compared to Vane![END]

=== 1 | 973a | 95 ===
[POR07]
Hiro! I need your help to
drive Borgan out of Vane
and rescue my mother![BRK]

Please, I've helped you on
your quest. Now it's time 
for you to help me![END]

=== 2 | 97e2 | 84 ===
[POR02]
Hiro, you're not really
going to make Lemina face
down Borgan all alone...[BRK]

...Are you?[BRK]

C'mon! Let's go back to
Vane and help her![END]

=== 3 | 987e | 60 ===
[POR05]
If I remember correctly,[BRK]

there was a transport device
here that connects Azado to
Pentagulia.[END]

=== 4 | 98f6 | 41 ===
[POR05]
I say we kill a little time
in town until the sanctuary
opens![END]

=== 5 | 994a | 98 ===
[POR05]
I'm positive there was a
transport device in the
sanctuary tower.[BRK]

It's gotta still be there![BRK]

If it works, it'll transfer
us to Pentagulia in no
time![END]

=== 6 | 99f8 | 14c ===
Welcome! Welcome!! This
is Azado, the good-time
port![BRK]

This is a great town. You're
guaranteed a smashing time
while you're here.[BRK]

Uh, that's if you don't
mind the fact that we're 
constantly under attack.[BRK]

But that's a small price to
pay for our hedonistic
pleasures![BRK]

Oh, and don't forget to
check out the awesomeness of
Azado Tower![END]

=== 7 | 9b5c | b8 ===
Welcome! Welcome!! Wel...[BRK]

Oh, it's just you.[BRK]

Um...disregard everything
you heard about our monster
problems, okay?[BRK]

Blasted bureaucrats won't 
let me talk about our 
local problems...[END]

=== 8 | 9c30 | 3d ===
Tourism has really picked
up since the last time you
visited.[END]

=== 9 | 9c7c | e5 ===
These tourists are annoying
the hell out of me.[BRK]

Always asking questions...
'Where is the tower?',
'Where is the tower?'[BRK]

Geez! Just look up, for
god's sake! It's the tallest
thing here![BRK]

Man! I hate dealing with the
public![END]

=== a | 9d7a | c5 ===
Dang! I just missed it!!
The gate to Althena's 
sanctuary just closed.[BRK]

It totally sucks because
the priests are the only
ones that sell the beads.[BRK]

You know, the beads that
ward off monster attacks.[END]

=== b | 9e42 | 4e ===
You won't be able to get
anywhere near the sanctuary
until they open the gate.[END]

=== c | 9eb2 | 9d ===
I've got to get into the
sanctuary![BRK]

It's the only place that
sells the anti-monster
beads![BRK]

My kids are scared, and
without those beads, I can't
protect them![END]

=== d | 9f52 | 140 ===
I wish the sanctuary was
open 24 hours![BRK]

I can't stand waiting to
get the beads![BRK]

[POR05]
I say let's blow this joint
until later.[BRK]

I think there's a gatekeeper
somewhere in town.[BRK]

Maybe if we find him, he'll
open the gate for us.[BRK]

Or, then again, maybe we'll
find some decent dice action
in this town...[BRK]

...Either way, I'm happy![END]

=== e | a0ae | d2 ===
It seems as if the only ones
making money off the monster
crisis is Althena's Cult.[BRK]

I'm starting to get the
feeling that we're being
had by the Cult![BRK]

But I just don't know how
they're controlling the
monsters![END]

=== f | a194 | 5d ===
Yes!! I got my beads.[BRK]

Hey, pal! You'd better hurry
and get yours before
they're all sold out.[END]

=== 10 | a200 | 6a ===
This just really pisses me
off![BRK]

I finally get those damn
beads and the monster
attacks stop![BRK]

Just my luck![END]

=== 11 | a27e | 141 ===
The greatest of the Four
Heroes is the legendary
White Knight Leo.[BRK]

Since my dad died from the
last monster attack, I had
no money to buy the beads.[BRK]

But the White Knight took
pity on me and gave me the
beads for free![BRK]

Hey, do you have anything
you wanna give me?[BRK]

[POR02]
You mean besides a lesson on
how impolite it is to beg?[END]

=== 12 | a3d6 | 7d ===
Silence! You stand in the
presence of the legendary
White Knight Leo Jr.[BRK]

I've decided that I'm gonna
adopt Leo as my new dad.[END]

=== 13 | a46a | 80 ===
Hey, hey, hey, guess what?
Leo destroyed the monsters![BRK]

I heard he totally kicked
their buttskies![BRK]

[POR02]
You heard wrong, troll-boy![END]

=== 14 | a506 | 33 ===
Lord Leo is the strongest
guy on the planet, huh?!![END]

=== 15 | a54c | d2 ===
Lord Leo isn't the White
Knight anymore...[BRK]

That doesn't matter, though.
I'm still gonna grow up and
be just like him![BRK]

People will read how Leo and
me saved this world. I'll be
just as famous as Leo!![BRK]

Cool, huh?[END]

=== 16 | a632 | 71 ===
I don't believe it! Oh Lord
Leo, please let me be your 
follower![BRK]

I promise I'll do everything
you command me to![END]

=== 17 | a6b0 | 6d ===
[POR09]
To follow me, all you must
do is believe in the power
of justice.[BRK]

Fight hard for truth, and
follow no one![END]

=== 18 | a730 | cf ===
30 years...360 payments...
and for what? I'll tell ya![BRK]

.............For nothing!!
Just look at this mess![BRK]

Those blasted monsters
destroyed my beautiful
home![BRK]

I knew I should've gotten
monster-raid insurance.[END]

=== 19 | a816 | b3 ===
Why?! Why?! Why didn't I
listen?[BRK]

But oh no! I thought, 'I
don't need no stinking
beads...'[BRK]

And look what it's got me![BRK]

A house that looks like it
belongs on the freakin'
east side![END]

=== 1a | a8dc | 65 ===
I wish they would've let me
kill that monster![BRK]

I would've tanned its hide
and used it to fix my roof![END]

=== 1b | a950 | 98 ===
The carpenter was just here.
He said he's gonna cut me a
deal on materials.[BRK]

And I just signed the loan
papers today. It's only
gonna be a 45-year loan![END]

=== 1c | a9fc | 1b7 ===
If I were you, I would stay
at the inn here in town.[BRK]

They have magic beads that
will protect you from
monster attacks.[BRK]

You never know where or
when the monsters are gonna
attack.[BRK]

They just appear out of
thin air and destroy what-
ever's in their path![BRK]

The beads are the only thing
that stops them.[BRK]

They won't touch a house
displaying them...[BRK]

[POR05]
It's a safe bet that I
won't be spending the night
here![BRK]

With or without those
stinkin' beads![END]

=== 1d | abca | c4 ===
Boom chaka laka...
Boom chaka laka...
Boom chaka laka boom.[BRK]

Boom! Boom! Boom! Monster's
coming! Boom![BRK]

Whooop! Whooop! Whooop! Go
go up in the sky and be
dead like a goose![BRK]

Whaaa-ha ha ha ha ha ha![END]

=== 1e | aca2 | 30 ===
Monster go boom! Boom! Boom!
Wah ha ha ha ha ha![END]

=== 1f | ace2 | 139 ===
Whew! For a while there,
I was totally insane![BRK]

I'm glad I got my sanity
back just in time to hear
about Leo's victory![BRK]

I couldn't believe it! There 
he was...all alone. Evil 
surrounded him. [BRK]

Nowhere to run. Nowhere to
hide...[BRK]

But Leo fearlessly thrust
his saber into Zophar's
black heart![BRK]

Talk about brave...Wow![END]

=== 20 | ae28 | 54 ===
[POR09]
The victory was not mine
alone.[BRK]

The greatest victories are
those that are shared.[END]

=== 21 | ae8c | 9f ===
The only thing worth having
around here is the beads
of Althena.[BRK]

But hey, my husband made
some that work just as
well.[BRK]

We're selling them on the
black market.[END]

=== 22 | af3e | 67 ===
I know that the last time
you didn't want any beads,
but now they're discounted.[BRK]

They're only 253,001s![END]

=== 23 | afb4 | c9 ===
I see you destroyed Zophar
without using my special
beads.[BRK]

You could've defeated him
in half the time if you
weren't such a cheap-o![BRK]

[POR02]
...Your beads are about
as useless as Lemina's
Guild memberships![END]

=== 24 | b08a | 58 ===
[POR05]
Hey, Ruby! There's no call
for picking on the li'l
lady![BRK]

At least she's a go-getter![END]

=== 25 | b0f6 | 1ac ===
The gals and I've been
talking lately.[BRK]

It seems the Goddess has
sealed some evil god in
or around Pentagulia![BRK]

They say his name is Zophar
or something...[BRK]

And just between you and
me...I think Zophar just
might be a hunk.[BRK]

He just needs the right
woman to tame his fiery
soul.[BRK]

[POR08]
No! No! No![BRK]

Zophar is the essence of
evil![BRK]

There's no telling how long
Althena's power can keep
him sealed![BRK]

Hiro, we must hurry and get
to Pentagulia.[END]

=== 26 | b2ba | c0 ===
Margery was tellin' me that
her and her husband have
been playing a new game.[BRK]

She pretends she's Goddess
Althena, and he pretends
he's the mighty Zophar.[BRK]

Her goal is to seal his 
unholy power.[END]

=== 27 | b38e | 58 ===
I heard that the god of
destruction was...[BRK]

Oh, Goddess Althena! Have
mercy on our souls![END]

=== 28 | b3f6 | 75 ===
I heard that Zophar was
defeated by mere mortals![BRK]

I didn't think humans
possessed such a power![BRK]

[POR02]
Well, guess again![END]

=== 29 | b47e | 6a ===
Have you heard about White
Knight Leo and Red Priest
Mauri?
[0x5]I don't think so.
Only about a hundred times.[END]

=== 2a | b4f8 | fb ===
Leo and Mauri are two of the
Four Heroes.[BRK]

Lord Leo is the head of 
Althena's Guard, and the
chief of the Destiny.[BRK]

Mauri is Leo's sister, and
high priestess to Goddess
Althena.[BRK]

Although I haven't ever seen
her, she's supposed to be
absolutely stunning.[END]

=== 2b | b600 | d ===
[POR05]
....
.....[END]

=== 2c | b620 | 4f ===
The only people that don't
know about the Four Heroes
are mentally incompetent.[END]

=== 2d | b682 | 11b ===
Look over here. My friend
just got the latest issue
of 'Busty Goddess Babes.'[BRK]

Quick! Turn to page 42![BRK]

...Ohhhh yeah...[BRK]

...See what I mean? That's
Mauri![BRK]

Oh baby! Just look at her
standing there in that red
lace ceremonial uniform![BRK]

I'm the Goddess Althena![BRK]

Come and serve me, Mauri![END]

=== 2e | b7b0 | a3 ===
I heard that the Four Heroes
have gone their own ways.[BRK]

And that Althena herself is
no more![BRK]

But the best rumor is that
Black Wizard Borgan's going
to take a bride![END]

=== 2f | b860 | 60 ===
[POR07]
Pooh! Over my dead body![BRK]

There's no chance that I'm
going to be that fat turd's
stepdaughter![END]

=== 30 | b8d4 | a8 ===
Say Leo, since you and Mauri
are no longer considered 
part of the Four Heroes,[BRK]

do you think that she'd
be free to perform a
ceremonial wash?[BRK]

I'd pay.....[BRK]

[POR09]
....
.....[END]

=== 31 | b990 | b9 ===
Lord Leo is so devoted to 
his work that I don't think
he's ever been in love.[BRK]

In fact, I don't think he
really knows what love is.[BRK]

I'd be honored if he would
let me show him the ropes![END]

=== 32 | ba60 | 85 ===
Leo is unlike any other guy
around here.[BRK]

I mean, wow! Just look at
the guy! Talk about buns
of steel![BRK]

I think his are more like
iron![END]

=== 33 | bafc | 5f ===
I just can't stop thinking
about how wonderful it would
be to be Leo's wife![BRK]

Talk about heaven![END]

=== 34 | bb76 | 40 ===
I sure hope Leo still comes
around.[BRK]

He can tame my beast anyday![END]

=== 35 | bbca | 78 ===
I don't think anyone can
capture the true essence
of manliness like Leo.[BRK]

He has an unspoken power
that just pulls me in![END]

=== 36 | bc56 | a0 ===
Oh my goodness! Leo! It's
really you![BRK]

Say, you wouldn't be in
need of a horn-polishing,
would you?[BRK]

[POR09]
....
.....[BRK]

[POR05]
Hey! Save some of that
polish for me, toots![END]

=== 37 | bd0a | 96 ===
I've heard that a Dragon-
master has returned to 
serve the Goddess Althena.[BRK]

The position of Dragonmaster
is the highest rank that
anyone can achieve.[END]

=== 38 | bdae | 87 ===
[POR08]
Why would the Goddess in
all her power rely on a
simple human to protect her?[BRK]

These Dragonmasters must 
possess extraordinary power![END]

=== 39 | be4c | 5f ===
The Goddess Althena has 
once again been reborn to
us...[BRK]

I wonder who her new 
Dragonmaster is?[END]

=== 3a | beba | 4c ===
The Dragonmaster is not a 
god, but merely a human with
extraordinary power.[END]

=== 3b | bf16 | 89 ===
Some believe that the
Four Dragons and the Dragon-
master...[BRK]

are powerful enough to
protect Althena forever.[BRK]

I find that hard to believe.[END]

=== 3c | bfb2 | 9c ===
I can't believe what people
say about Althena, the Four
Dragons,[BRK]

...and the Dragonmaster![BRK]

I mean, if I believed that,
I could believe that Vane
used to fly![END]

=== 3d | c05c | 50 ===
[POR07]
Why wouldn't you believe
that, nimrod?[BRK]

Of course Vane used to
fly in the sky![END]

=== 3e | c0c0 | 145 ===
I'm going back to school
so that I can learn about
our history.[BRK]

The Blue Star, the Goddess,
dragons and heroic Dragon-
masters...[BRK]

...I need to learn more
about all of this. Maybe
some of it is true.[BRK]

I must know, because only
by understanding the past
can I build a bright future.[BRK]

[POR02]
What do you know? Dinglenut
found a brain![END]

=== 3f | c21c | b4 ===
Man, you've just got to read 
these ancient books![BRK]

They contain some of the
greatest adventures I've
ever heard about![BRK]

Some of it is just so
stinkin' fantastic, it's
beyond belief![END]

=== 40 | c2e4 | b2 ===
My husband keeps telling me
he has to make sure our new
neighbor is all right.[BRK]

I think he's more interested
in checking her out...[BRK]

But if I catch him oogling,
it's Bobbitt time![END]

=== 41 | c3ae | 4b ===
I've already filed for a 
divorce from my no-good
husband![BRK]

...Men are pigs![END]

=== 42 | c410 | 7b ===
Hey, I've got a piece of
advice for you women.[BRK]

Don't ever give your
heart to a man.[BRK]

They'll break it into a
million pieces.[END]

=== 43 | c49c | 1c ===
[POR02]
Hiro would never do that![END]

=== 44 | c4d4 | 4c ===
I've heard that Lord Leo
might come here. I hope so![BRK]

His buns are legendary![END]

=== 45 | c534 | 98 ===
I don't believe it! Leo
killed the beast and didn't
even stop by to tell me![BRK]

That's a man for you. They
do their job and you never
hear from them again![END]

=== 46 | c5e0 | df ===
Leo! You've come back to me![BRK]

Come! Take me into your
strong arms and plant
a passionate one on me![BRK]

[POR09]
I'm sorry, I cannot stray
from my path of redemption.[BRK]

[POR02]
Oh Leo! Honey lips! Tame me![BRK]

Hehehe...[BRK]

Gag me with a jackhammer![END]

=== 47 | c6d2 | da ===
One of the priests from the
Cult was here the other 
day.[BRK]

He said that Pentagulia has
been sealed to protect the
Goddess.[BRK]

But I also heard that a
fearsome evil is already in
Pentagulia![BRK]

[POR08]
Then...Althena and Zophar...[END]

=== 48 | c7c4 | 90 ===
Why can't ordinary citizens
go to Pentagulia, even for
a visit?[BRK]

I donate good money to the
Cult...[BRK]

...and now I want to see
what I'm paying for.[END]

=== 49 | c868 | 8e ===
These priests never give up.[BRK]

One was here the other day
saying if he didn't receive
eight million Silver,[BRK]

the Goddess was gonna take
him away![END]

=== 4a | c90a | 8c ===
I've had enough of these
priests and their noble
causes![BRK]

I draw the line when one of 
them asks me to donate so
his dog can have a facelift![END]

=== 4b | c9aa | 7c ===
Leo! I'm glad you're 
all right![BRK]

I was worried that you
might not return from
the battle![BRK]

[POR09]
Our victory was never in
doubt.[END]

=== 4c | ca3a | d7 ===
Step right up, my good man.[BRK]

I know what you're

full of holes,[BRK]

but let me show you some of
the finer things about this

Now that the monsters are

Lord Leo! Have you come to

No. You don't need me to

He holds ultimate power
over the Four Dragons of
our world.[END]

[POR08]
Why would Althena rely on
the power of a Dragonmaster?[END]

=== e4 | 17578 | 6a ===
The Dragonmaster has no
equal.[BRK]

Since he controls the power
of the Four Dragons, he 
is amazingly powerful.[END]

=== e5 | 175f2 | 9d ===
I can't believe that Zophar
revived Ghaleon from the
dead![BRK]

If he hadn't been stopped, 
he could have destroyed our
whole world![BRK]

[POR02]
Correct-a-mundo, Einstein![END]

=== e6 | 176a2 | 64 ===
Hey! Get in line! I was 
here first![BRK]

It's always been first
come, first served.[BRK]

Where have you been?[END]

=== e7 | 1771e | 49 ===
I was here first. So I 
should be allowed to buy
the beads first, dipwad![END]

=== e8 | 1777a | 89 ===
I wonder if the priests will
give me a complimentary set
of beads?[BRK]

I've spent all my money
on a bad hair weave, but I'm
not ready to die![END]

=== e9 | 1781a | 4a ===
Hey, mister, d'you think
you could spare some change
for a fellow warrior?[END]

=== ea | 17874 | 86 ===
I can't believe my parents
are wasting my allowance on
a bunch of dumb old beads![BRK]

I told them they should
trade our dumb cow for
them.[END]

=== eb | 1790e | 82 ===
I think we should forget
about these dumb beads.[BRK]

I'm telling you, if you
bought cool swords you could
kick some dumb monster butt![END]

=== ec | 179a8 | 3d ===
Man, I really want a
sword![BRK]

But my mom won't let me
have one![END]

=== ed | 179f8 | cf ===
Wait until these priests
get a load of the heat
I'm packin'![BRK]

We've passed a new law 
requiring that priests pay
taxes on their money.[BRK]

And I'm the new tax auditor.[BRK]

Say, what is your primary
source of revenue?[END]

=== ee | 17ade | ab ===
You should've seen the high
priest when I told him that
I needed to look at his...[BRK]

...financial statement for
the last seven years.[BRK]

I thought he was going to
drop a brick![END]

=== ef | 17b9c | 9e ===
Man, I'm really cleanin' up
in here![BRK]

I've taken enough hush money
from these priests...[BRK]

...to pay my way to a nice
quiet island for the rest
of my life![END]

=== f0 | 17c4a | 78 ===
I'll tell you, being a hard-
nosed tax auditor can make
you rich fast![BRK]

...If you know how to play
your cards just right.[END]
