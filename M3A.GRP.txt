Nope. We're not getting in
this way.[BRK]

The door's locked.[END]

=== 1 | 17954 | 14d ===
[POR17]
Well, well! If it isn't
my dear Lemina![BRK]

You're the last person I
would have expected to
see in Pentagulia.[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR07]
Shut up, you overweight
toad![BRK]

I'm tired of listening to
your trite speeches.[BRK]

I have two reasons for being
here. The first is to rescue
my mother.[BRK]

And the second is to make
sure that you never again
set foot in Vane...[END]

=== 2 | 17ac0 | 7d ===
Borgan is the most powerful
wizard that's ever existed.[BRK]

He's created an entirely new
magic city that is far
better than Vane![END]

=== 3 | 17b50 | 52 ===
We are already preparing to
recognize Borgan as the new
leader of the Magic Guild.[END]

=== 4 | 17bb2 | 74 ===
Lord Borgan is the rightful
leader of the Magic Guild.[BRK]

He's more interested in Vane
than that money-grubbing
Lemina.[END]

=== 5 | 17c3a | 94 ===
Even though Borgan is as 
ugly as a festering boil,[BRK]

Lady Miria has fallen in 
love with him. [BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

Honestly...I don't know
how she does it...[END]

=== 6 | 17cde | d1 ===
Halt![BRK]

...Wait![BRK]

Aren't you...??[BRK]

Yes! Yes! We met in Vane.
Don't you remember me?[BRK]

...You must remember me. I
was walking around, and we
made eye contact...[BRK]

I even said 'Hi' to you![BRK]

Come on! You must remember
me![END]

=== 7 | 17dc2 | 6d ===
You know, you can't keep
running away from me![BRK]

I know we met. Just admit
that you saw me. That's all
I ask...[END]

=== 8 | 17e3e | a0 ===
Since Borgan has the power
of the Black Dragon, he's
become invincible, I think.[BRK]

Only two people have more
power than him...[BRK]

...Althena and Ghaleon.[END]

=== 9 | 17ef2 | 79 ===
With the power of the Black
Dragon, Borgan will never
be defeated.[BRK]

He's definitely become the
best magician in the world.[END]

I overheard your
conversation.[BRK]

Something very sinister is
going on around here, and
I don't like it.[BRK]

I'm beginning to think I
have been duped into being
part of some evil plan![BRK]

I must find out what the
true intentions of Althena
are.[BRK]

Perhaps if we work together,
we can solve this mystery.[BRK]

In any case, we must first
find Lucia and hear her
story.[BRK]

She's being held in the
shrine on the second floor
of Althena's tower.[BRK]

We can get to the shrine
by means of a secret passage
below these towers.[BRK]

Let's go![BRK]

[POR05]
....
.....[BRK]

...Did you tire of the mask,
friend? [BRK]

[POR09]
What are you talking about?[BRK]

I know nothing of a mask,
Ronfar.[BRK]

I have no time for games.[BRK]

Your precious Lucia's life
hangs in the balance.[END]

[POR07]
Whew! Talk about mega-nick-
of-time![BRK]

I didn't know if you guys
were even still alive![BRK]

....
.....[BRK]

...Hey! Who's the party
dude in the mask?[BRK]

[POR02]
Funny you should ask...[BRK]

We're playing a little game.[BRK]

Lord Leo has decided to play
this part called 'Mystere',
and we're playing along.[BRK]

We're not supposed to know
who he is...but he's helping
us...I think...[BRK]

[POR07]
Whatever floats his boat.[BRK]

Anyway, I can't believe what
that stupid Borgan did.[BRK]

...I'll never forgive him! 
I hope he chokes on all the
food he eats!![BRK]

Get a load of this...[END]

[POR17]
Well, well! If it isn't
my dear Lemina![BRK]

You're the last person I
would have expected to
see in Pentagulia.[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR07]
Shut up, you overweight
toad![BRK]

I'm tired of listening to
your trite speeches.[BRK]

I have two reasons for being
here. The first is to rescue
my mother.[BRK]

And the second is to make
sure that you never again
set foot in Vane![BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR17]
I find your manner so...
I don't know...delicious.[BRK]

You're always hell-bent on
changing others.[BRK]

Perhaps you should consider
changing yourself![BRK]

Besides, your mother is no
longer in Pentagulia.[BRK]

She's busy making a new 
home for us in Neo-Vane,
my illustrious magic city.[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR07]
Neo-Vane!?[BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR17]
Yes, that's right. Neo-Vane,
cupcake![BRK]

And, surprise of surprises,
she loves it![BRK]

But why shouldn't she? Her
surroundings are those of a
queen.[BRK]

I have given her the finest
of everything in this world![BRK]

And all I ask is that she
grow to love me.[BRK]

Despite what you think, it
can be done.[BRK]

If you try hard enough, I'm
certain you can do the same.[BRK]

I'll think of you as the
daughter I never had.[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR07]
...Daughter!?[BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR17]
Yes! Soon Miria will agree
to be my wife. I can feel
it![BRK]

After Miria and I are 
united,[BRK]

your ability to revive the
Magic Guild of Vane will
be forever sealed.[BRK]

I'm afraid you don't stand
a chance of stopping me,
cream-puff.[BRK]

[POR00]
[ROR07]
I won't allow you to do
this![BRK]

[ROR00]
[POR17]
I'd suggest you get a handle
on your emotions, sweetie.[BRK]

Soon, the only words you'll 
utter will be those of a
loyal daughter...[BRK]

When Zophar is revived, the
power of Neo-Vane will
finally be...[BRK]

...Oops. I almost let the
cat out of the bag.[BRK]

I can't let you in on that
little secret until we're
back in Neo-Vane.[BRK]

Believe me, poopsie, you'll
feel right at home...[BRK]

But since you seem a little
averse to the idea right
now,[BRK]

I'd better put you in a
holding cell.[BRK]

Sweet dreams...[BRK]

...............Daughter![END]

=== 12 | 1b5b2 | 8b ===
[POR07]
There is no way that I'm
going back to Neo-Vane
with that bucket of lard![BRK]

We've got to find a way out
of here so I can rescue my
mother![END]

=== 13 | 1b654 | 66 ===
[POR13]
You're all reunited. My
job is finished.[BRK]

Good luck! And remember
always...[BRK]

...............Mystere![END]

=== 14 | 1b6c4 | 144 ===
[POR02]
Thank you, Mystere.[BRK]

...I can't believe Leo 
thinks he's really fooling
us with that mask.[BRK]

[POR05]
Ruby, if Leo helped us 
without using some sort of
disguise...[BRK]

it could very well have cost
him and others their lives.[BRK]

Leo has pledged his 
allegiance to the Althena 
Cult.[BRK]

For now, this is probably
the only way he can help
us.[END]
